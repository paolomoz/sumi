# Art Nouveau Style Guide

## Overview
Art Nouveau (c. 1890-1910) is a decorative art style characterized by organic, flowing lines inspired by natural forms. Known for its sinuous curves, botanical motifs, and integration of art into everyday objects and architecture.

## Visual Characteristics

### Line Work
- Long, sinuous, flowing curves (the "whiplash" line)
- Organic, asymmetric forms inspired by plants and flowers
- Lines that flow naturally from structural to decorative elements
- Intertwining tendrils, vines, and stems as border elements
- Hair and fabric rendered as flowing, wave-like forms

### Color Palette
- Muted, nature-inspired tones: sage green, dusty rose, gold, cream, deep teal
- Rich jewel tones used as accents: amethyst purple, emerald, sapphire
- Gold leaf and metallic accents for luxury feel
- Soft gradients within organic shapes
- Earth tones grounded by deep blacks or dark greens

### Composition
- Vertical, elongated formats common (poster tradition)
- Central figure or motif framed by organic border elements
- Symmetry broken by organic asymmetry
- Border frames made of intertwining botanical elements

### Nature Motifs
- Lilies, irises, orchids, and water lilies

### Decorative Elements
- Mosaic-like background patterns (Klimt influence)
- Stained glass window compositions (Tiffany influence)
- Ornamental frames with flowing botanical borders
- Medallions and roundels for focal points
