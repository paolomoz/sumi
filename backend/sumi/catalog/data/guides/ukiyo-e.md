# Ukiyo-e Style Guide

## Overview
Ukiyo-e ("pictures of the floating world") is a genre of Japanese art flourishing from the 17th through 19th centuries. Known for woodblock prints depicting landscapes, kabuki actors, beautiful women, and scenes from history and folk tales.

## Visual Characteristics

### Line Work
- Bold, confident outlines with varying thickness
- Clean, flowing contour lines defining forms
- Minimal crosshatching; areas defined by flat color fills
- Calligraphic quality to all linework

### Color Palette
- Traditional palette: indigo blue (ai-zome), vermillion red, ochre yellow, soft green, black, cream/off-white
- Colors are flat and unmodulated — no gradients within a single area
- Limited palette per composition (typically 5-8 colors)
- Background often features soft gradation (bokashi technique) from color to white

### Composition
- Asymmetric compositions with strong diagonal elements
- Layered depth using overlapping planes (foreground/middle/background)
- Dramatic cropping — subjects often extend beyond frame edges
- Empty space (ma) used intentionally as a compositional element
- Vertical format (kakemono-e) common for single-sheet prints

### Nature Elements
- Stylized waves with repeating curl patterns (inspired by Hokusai)
- Cherry blossoms, pine trees, bamboo as recurring motifs
- Mount Fuji as iconic background element
- Clouds rendered as flat decorative bands
- Rain depicted as parallel diagonal lines

### Text Integration
- Cartouches (bordered text boxes) for titles and poems
- Text placed in upper corners or along edges
- Vertical Japanese calligraphy style
- Seal stamps (hanko) as decorative signature elements

## For Infographic Adaptation

### Layout Zones
- Top banner area with decorative cartouche for title
- Central illustration area with bold subject matter
- Side panels for supporting text labels
- Bottom area for attribution or additional info
- Use wave or cloud patterns as section dividers

### Typography Guidance
- Use elegant serif or brush-stroke fonts
- Text in bordered cartouche panels
- Vertical text orientation references Japanese tradition
- Color contrast: dark text on light panels, or white text on indigo

### Do's
- Use flat color fills with bold outlines
- Include nature motifs as decorative elements
- Employ asymmetric, layered compositions
- Use the bokashi gradient technique for backgrounds
- Include cartouche-style text panels

### Don'ts
- Don't use photorealistic rendering or 3D effects
- Don't use gradients within individual objects
- Don't overcrowd — respect empty space (ma)
- Don't use modern/digital textures
- Don't mix with Western perspective rules
