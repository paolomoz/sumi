# ligne-claire

Clean, uniform-weight black outlines enclose every shape — figures, objects, buildings, and text containers alike — filled with flat, unmodulated color fields, creating the democratic draftsmanship of Franco-Belgian bandes dessinées. Every element shares the same crisp ink line regardless of foreground or background importance, producing infographics that read like a lost page from a Tintin album: precise, luminous, and deceptively simple.

## Variants
| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Album Cover | Bold hero illustration dominates, minimal text, large flat color fields | Single central scene with 2-3 color blocks, title in clean sans-serif inside outlined banner |
| Reporter's Notebook | Dense informational panels, small character vignettes, labeled diagrams | Grid of outlined boxes with cutaway illustrations, numbered callouts, map insets |
| Technical Blueprint | Exploded views, cross-sections, mechanical detail with equal line weight | Vehicles, devices, or buildings shown in cutaway with every rivet and panel outlined at uniform weight |
| Street Scene | Environmental storytelling, architecture, signage, figures in context | Wide establishing shot composition with buildings, vehicles, pedestrians — all at same line hierarchy |

## Visual Elements
- **Uniform black outlines on every single shape**: Every object — from a tiny rivet to an entire building facade — is enclosed by the same 2-3px black ink line with no variation in weight, no tapering, no feathering
- **Absolutely flat color fills**: Each enclosed region is filled with a single unmodulated color — no gradients, no airbrushing, no soft shading, no cel-shading, no color transitions within a shape
- **No drop shadows, no glows, no ambient occlusion**: Depth is communicated purely through overlapping shapes and consistent perspective, never through shadow effects
- **Precise architectural linework**: Buildings rendered with every window, cornice, balcony rail, and doorframe drawn in clean parallel lines; European Art Deco and Modernist architecture preferred — mansard roofs, rounded balconies, geometric facades
- **Small figures with dot eyes and simple features**: Human figures are 6-7 heads tall, with round heads, dot or small oval eyes, simple curved-line mouths, and distinctive silhouettes defined by clothing and hair shape rather than facial detail
- **Vehicles drawn with engineering precision**: Cars, planes, rockets, and boats rendered with every panel line, wheel spoke, and porthole visible — technically accurate but never photorealistic, always enclosed in that uniform outline
- **Flat sky backgrounds**: Skies are a single flat color field (cerulean, pale blue, or cream) — NO clouds with shading, NO atmospheric perspective, NO color gradients from horizon to zenith
- **Panel borders as thick black rectangles**: Every content container is a clean rectangular black-outlined box with squared corners; panels sit on a white or cream gutter
- **Numbered callout circles**: Small circles with black outlines containing a number in clean sans-serif, connected to diagram elements by thin straight leader lines
- **Map insets with naive cartography**: Small maps rendered in the style of adventure-book endpapers — coastlines as single black lines, terrain as flat color zones, dotted-line travel routes, compass roses with simple pointed stars
- **Onomatopoeia as outlined display type**: Sound effects and emphasis words rendered as large outlined letterforms filled with flat color, integrated into the composition like physical objects
- **Cross-hatching completely absent**: Volume is NEVER suggested through hatching, stippling, or any mark-making texture — only through flat color value changes between adjacent outlined shapes
- **Speech-bubble style annotations**: Rounded rectangles or ellipses with small triangular tails pointing to their subject, outlined in the same uniform black line, filled white with black text
- **Consistent lighting with no cast shadows**: Objects appear evenly lit as if under diffuse overcast light; there are no cast shadows on ground planes, no shadow sides of buildings, no dramatic lighting

| Balance | A brass laboratory scale with outlined weights on each pan, perfectly level, on a flat wooden laboratory bench |
| Collaboration | Two figures at a flat-color desk, each holding one end of an unfolded map, their outlines overlapping naturally |

## Typography
- **Primary Typeface**: Clean geometric sans-serif with uniform stroke width — Futura, Avenir, or Proxima Nova; the letterforms must echo the uniform line weight of the illustrations
- **Title Treatment**: ALL CAPS in bold weight, tracked wide, enclosed in an outlined banner or ribbon shape filled with flat color; 28-36pt equivalent
- **Body Labels**: Sentence case, regular weight, 12-16pt equivalent, always inside an outlined container (panel, speech bubble, or rectangular caption box) — NEVER floating freely over illustration
- **Number Callouts**: Bold numerals inside small outlined circles, 10-14pt, matching the illustration's line weight exactly
- **Caption Boxes**: Rectangular outlined containers at top or bottom of panels with cream or pale yellow fill, containing narrative or explanatory text in regular weight
- **NO decorative, script, or serif typefaces**: Every letterform must have uniform stroke width to harmonize with the ligne claire outline system
- **NO text with drop shadows, outlines-on-outlines, or gradient fills**: Text is flat black on light fill or flat white on dark fill, period

## Anti-Patterns
- **NO gradients anywhere — NOT in backgrounds, NOT in fills, NOT in skies, NOT in any shape**: Every color region is a single flat value. If you see a gradient, it is wrong. Repeat: **NO GRADIENTS**
- **NO line weight variation**: Do NOT make foreground outlines thicker than background outlines. Do NOT taper lines. Do NOT use brush-like strokes. Every outline is the same mechanical, uniform weight. **This is the single most defining rule of ligne claire**
- **NO hatching, cross-hatching, stippling, or textural mark-making**: Volume is NEVER communicated through pen marks. **NO scratchy lines, NO etched shading, NO engraved textures**
- **NO drop shadows, NO cast shadows, NO ambient occlusion, NO shadow sides of objects**: The world is evenly lit. There is no shadow. **Repeat: ZERO shadows of any kind**
- **NO photorealistic rendering**: This is NOT a photograph. Do NOT use photographic textures, lens effects, depth of field, or volumetric lighting
- **NO manga/anime influence**: Do NOT use large expressive eyes, speed-line backgrounds, sweat drops, chibi proportions, or screentone patterns. Ligne claire is European, restrained, observational
- **NO American superhero comic style**: Do NOT use dynamic foreshortening, exaggerated musculature, heavy black spotting (large filled black shadow shapes), or dramatic chiaroscuro
- **NO watercolor, painterly, or impressionistic effects**: Edges are hard and precise. There is no wet-into-wet bleeding, no visible brushstroke, no paper texture showing through
- **NO decorative borders, ornamental frames, or art nouveau flourishes**: Panel borders are plain rectangles. Frames are simple black outlines. There are no vine motifs, no Celtic knots, no decorative corners
- **NO scattered floating elements**: Objects exist in physical space on surfaces, in hands, on shelves. They do NOT float randomly in empty space as decorative filler. **NO confetti, NO floating icons, NO sprinkled motifs**
- **NO glow effects, NO neon, NO bloom**: Light sources (lamps, screens, explosions) are drawn as flat color shapes with black outlines, same as everything else. They do NOT emit rendered light
- **NO 3D rendering or isometric projection with shading**: If using cutaway or exploded views, they are flat orthographic or simple perspective with uniform outlines, NOT rendered 3D models
