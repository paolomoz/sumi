# memphis

Loud, clashing, deliberately "bad taste" 1980s postmodern design — hot pink triangles colliding with acid yellow zigzags on a speckled terrazzo background, thick black outlines around everything, squiggly lines crawling across surfaces like rebellious graffiti. This is Ettore Sottsass's Carlton bookshelf, a Nathalie du Pasquier fabric print, a De Stijl grid having a wild party with a pack of highlighter markers. Maximalist, irreverent, and unapologetically fun.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Hot pink (#E84393), electric blue (#0984E3), acid yellow (#FFEAA7 bright) / banana yellow (#FDCB6E)
- Background: Bright white (#FFFFFF) with scattered confetti/terrazzo speckles, OR solid hot pink / electric blue / black panels
- Darks: True black (#000000) for thick outlines, bold stripes, and high-contrast pattern fills
- Accents: Teal green (#00CEC9), coral red (#FF6348), lavender purple (#A29BFE), mint green (#55EFC4), tangerine orange (#E17055)
- Text: Black on white or colored panels; white reversed out of black or dark panels; never gray — always maximum contrast

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Classic Memphis | Hot pink + electric blue + acid yellow + black outlines on white — the canonical Sottsass triad, maximum clash |
| Neon Night | Black background + hot pink + teal green + lavender purple + acid yellow accents — nightclub energy, neon signage glow |
| Pastel Clash | Mint green + coral + lavender + banana yellow on white — softer but still deliberately mismatched, like a du Pasquier textile |
| Primary Pop | Red + blue + yellow + black + white — bold primary triad with thick black outlines, closest to the original Memphis Group furniture |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Sottsass** | Bold totemic forms, stacked geometric shapes like Memphis furniture | Vertical columns of clashing colored shapes stacked on top of each other like the Carlton bookshelf — triangles on cylinders on rectangles, each a different loud color, all outlined in thick black. Terrazzo-speckled backgrounds |
| **Du Pasquier** | Dense allover pattern, textile-like surface decoration | Every surface crawling with a different pattern — zigzags on one panel, dots on another, squiggles on a third, stripes on a fourth. Patterns clash on purpose. Colors clash on purpose. The horror vacui of 1980s Memphis textiles |
| **Pop Geometric** | Clean bold shapes floating on white, less pattern density | Large isolated geometric shapes — triangles, circles, semicircles, zigzag strips — scattered across a white field with thick black outlines. Fewer patterns, bigger shapes, more breathing room. Confetti dots sprinkled in the negative space |
| **Neon** | Dark background with neon-bright shapes glowing against black | Black or very dark charcoal background with hot pink, teal, acid yellow, and lavender shapes popping forward. Thick colored outlines instead of black. The night-mode version of Memphis |

## Visual Elements

- **Thick black outlines** around every shape — 4-6px stroke weight, confident and bold, like a coloring book drawn with a fat marker. This is the single most defining Memphis visual trait
- **Zigzag/chevron bands** running horizontally or diagonally across panels — jagged lightning-bolt stripes in clashing colors (hot pink zigzag on yellow, blue zigzag on white)
- **Squiggly lines** — loose, hand-drawn wavy lines meandering across surfaces like a phone-doodle, in contrasting colors against their background
- **Terrazzo/confetti speckle** — small irregular dots, triangles, and dashes scattered randomly across backgrounds, like confetti frozen mid-air. Use pink, blue, yellow, and black specks on white
- **Bold geometric shapes as characters** — triangles, circles, semicircles, and rectangles used as standalone visual elements, not as containers. Each shape a different saturated color, all outlined in black
- **Clashing pattern fills** — shapes filled with different patterns: one triangle filled with polka dots, the next with diagonal stripes, the next with crosshatch. Patterns intentionally mismatched
- **Columns and totems** — shapes stacked vertically like Memphis furniture legs: a cone on top of a cylinder on top of a stepped rectangle, each a different color
- **Grid lines that wobble** — underlying grids rendered with slight irregularity, not perfectly straight, giving a playful hand-drawn quality
- **Oversized polka dots** — large circles (not small uniform dots) scattered at irregular intervals, each a different bright color
- **Semicircles and quarter-circles** used as standalone shapes, arches, and decorative accents — a signature Memphis form
- **Diagonal stripe bands** in two contrasting colors (black/yellow, pink/blue) used as borders, dividers, and accent strips
- **NO gradients, NO shadows, NO 3D effects** — everything is flat, graphic, and boldly outlined
- **NO subtle anything** — every color choice, pattern, and shape should feel deliberately loud

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Stacked totem of shapes — largest/most important at base, each level a different color and pattern, getting smaller toward the top, like a Memphis bookshelf | Sottsass Carlton divider — vertical stack of zigzagging shelves |
| Flow/process | Zigzag path cutting diagonally across the composition, each bend a different color panel with its own pattern fill, numbered with bold circled digits | A lightning bolt slicing through a terrazzo field |
| Connections | Squiggly lines connecting scattered geometric shapes — circles linked by wobbly hand-drawn lines across a confetti-speckled white field | Phone-doodle diagram on graph paper |
| Cycles | Shapes arranged in a loose circle, connected by a thick dotted line, the whole thing slightly off-kilter and asymmetric | Memphis clock face with mismatched hour markers |
| Comparison | Split composition with a bold diagonal stripe divider — left side one clashing color/pattern combo, right side a completely different one | Two Memphis fabric swatches side by side |
| Categories | Each category gets its own geometric shape (triangles for one, circles for another, rectangles for a third), each with its own pattern fill and loud color | Memphis furniture collection — each piece a different wild combination |
| Growth | Ascending zigzag staircase of shapes getting progressively larger and more complex, each step a different color | Memphis staircase motif climbing from lower-left to upper-right |
| Networks | Scattered geometric nodes connected by squiggly lines on a terrazzo background, each node a different shape/color/pattern | Nathalie du Pasquier pattern with linked geometric forms |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Memphis Metaphor |
|------------------|------------------|
| Data/information | Bold geometric shapes of proportional size — big circle for big data, small triangle for small data — each a different clashing color |
| Processes | Zigzag path with numbered stops, each stop a different-colored geometric shape with pattern fill |
| Systems | Stacked totem of interlocking shapes, each component a different color and pattern, assembled like Memphis furniture |
| Connections | Squiggly hand-drawn lines linking scattered shapes across a confetti-speckled field |
| Growth | Ascending staircase of shapes getting larger, each step a louder color than the last |
| Time | Horizontal zigzag timeline with bold circled numbers at each peak and valley, alternating colors |
| Hierarchy | Vertical stack — biggest boldest shape at base, diminishing upward, each level a different pattern |
| Protection | Thick black-outlined rectangle or circle enclosing content, with terrazzo pattern outside the boundary |
| Speed | Diagonal stripe bands and zigzag chevrons pointing right, hot pink and yellow on black |
| Stability | Large black-outlined rectangle anchoring the composition, filled with a steady grid pattern |
| Users/people | Figures built from stacked geometric shapes — circle head, triangle torso, rectangle legs — each body part a different bright color with black outlines |
| Ideas | Radiating starburst of squiggly lines around a central shape, like an explosion of confetti |
| Energy | Multiple zigzag bands crossing and overlapping, hot pink + acid yellow + electric blue clashing together |
| Tension/conflict | Two clashing pattern fields meeting at a jagged diagonal boundary — dots vs. stripes, pink vs. blue |

## Typography

- Heavy bold sans-serif — chunky, confident, taking up space unapologetically
- Mixed weights for emphasis: ultra-bold headlines crashing against thin body text
- Letters can overlap shapes, sit on top of patterns, break out of their containers
- Key words in contrasting highlight colors — a yellow word on a pink panel, a blue word on white
- Slight rotation (2-5 degrees) on headlines for playful energy — not perfectly horizontal
- All-caps for titles and labels, mixed case for body text
- Black text with thick outlines, or white text reversed out of colored panels
- NO elegant serif faces, NO script fonts, NO thin weights — everything is bold and graphic
- Letter-spacing can be tight (headlines) or wide (labels) but never neutral

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT corporate Memphis** (the modern Silicon Valley flat illustration style). Corporate Memphis uses muted tones, squishy blobby figures, and gentle gradients. True Memphis Design uses eye-searing color clashes, thick black outlines, geometric shapes, and deliberately jarring pattern combinations. They share a name but are completely different aesthetics.
- **NOT Bauhaus** — Bauhaus is systematic, harmonious, and purposeful. Memphis is deliberately anarchic, clashing, and irreverent. If it looks balanced and tasteful, it's wrong.
- **NOT pop art** — Pop art uses halftone dots, comic-book imagery, and commercial references. Memphis uses geometric shapes, zigzags, terrazzo, and architectural forms. No Lichtenstein dots, no Warhol repetition.
- **NOT vaporwave or synthwave** — those are purple/pink gradient aesthetics with grid horizons. Memphis is flat, outlined, and pattern-based with no gradients at all.
- **NOT Art Deco** — Art Deco is symmetrical, opulent, gold-and-black luxury. Memphis is asymmetrical, plastic, and deliberately anti-luxury.
- **NOT a clean modern infographic with Memphis colors** — the patterns and clashing combinations ARE the point. A clean grid with hot pink and blue but no zigzags, squiggles, terrazzo, or clashing patterns is just a colorful infographic, not Memphis.
- This must look like an Ettore Sottsass furniture showroom exploded onto paper — loud, clashing, pattern-on-pattern, thick outlines, confetti everywhere — not a tidy graphic design exercise that happens to use bright colors.
