# isometric-technical

Precise three-dimensional diagrams drawn at exact 30-degree angles — clean white surfaces with measured shadows, cutaway views revealing inner workings, exploded assemblies floating in perfect alignment, and crisp linework documenting every component. This is an engineering manual, a patent illustration, a NASA technical diagram — where complex systems are made comprehensible through the disciplined geometry of axonometric projection.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Clean white (#FFFFFF), technical gray (#6B7280), blueprint blue (#2563EB)
- Background: Light warm gray (#F5F5F5), pure white, or subtle grid paper pattern
- Structure: Light gray surfaces (#E5E7EB), medium gray shadows (#9CA3AF), dark gray edges (#374151)
- Accents: Signal red (#DC2626) for callouts and critical parts, safety yellow (#FBBF24) for warnings, system green (#22C55E) for active/good states
- Section colors: Soft fills for cutaway interiors — pale blue (#DBEAFE), pale orange (#FED7AA), pale green (#D1FAE5)
- Lines: Dark gray or black for outlines (#1F2937), lighter gray for secondary detail (#9CA3AF), blue for dimension lines (#3B82F6)

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Blueprint | White + light gray + blueprint blue + dark gray lines — classic technical documentation feel |
| Engineering | White + gray gradations + red callouts + yellow warnings — industrial manual aesthetic |
| Architectural | Warm white + cool gray shadows + black lines + pale section fills — building cutaway style |
| Digital System | White + soft blue + green status indicators + gray infrastructure — data center/server diagram look |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Cutaway** | Revealed interior structure | External shell partially removed showing internal components, section plane visible, interior parts in contrasting color to exterior |
| **Exploded** | Separated components in assembly sequence | Parts floating apart along assembly axis lines, dotted lines showing alignment, each component labeled |
| **System** | Multiple connected units and flows | Various isometric boxes and shapes connected by pipes, wires, or arrows showing how parts work together |
| **Architectural** | Building or spatial structure | Rooms, floors, walls shown in isometric, some walls removed to reveal interior, furniture and contents visible |

## Visual Elements

- True isometric projection: all vertical lines stay vertical, all horizontal lines at exactly 30 degrees to horizontal — the mathematical precision is essential
- Clean crisp outlines: consistent stroke weight (typically 1-2px) in dark gray or black, defining every edge clearly
- Flat surfaces with subtle shadow: one consistent light source (typically upper-left), surfaces facing away from light in slightly darker gray
- Cutaway section planes: clean diagonal or horizontal cuts through objects, interior surfaces in a different (often warmer or colored) fill than exterior
- Exploded view assembly lines: thin dashed lines or arrows showing how separated parts align and connect when assembled
- Dimension lines and measurements: thin lines with terminal marks (arrows or slashes) showing size, numbers in technical font
- Numbered callouts: circles with numbers connected by leader lines to specific parts, with corresponding legend
- Component labels: technical typography pointing to parts, often with part numbers (A-1, B-2, etc.)
- Grid patterns on surfaces: suggesting scale, structure, or material (like a tiled floor or panel grid)
- Transparent or ghosted elements: some parts drawn with dashed lines or lighter fill to show hidden internal structure
- NO perspective distortion (lines don't converge), NO loose sketchy lines, NO decorative elements — everything serves to explain structure

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Vertical stack of isometric layers, most important at top, supporting infrastructure below — like a building cross-section from roof to foundation | Data center architecture — user interface on top, servers at bottom |
| Flow/process | Left-to-right sequence of isometric stages, each stage showing the system at a different point in the process, arrows indicating flow direction | Manufacturing process — raw material enters left, product exits right |
| Connections | Multiple isometric units connected by visible pipes, cables, or lines, showing data/material/energy flow between components | System diagram — how server A talks to database B through network C |
| Comparison | Two isometric views side by side at same angle: version A vs. version B, or old vs. new, or option 1 vs. option 2 | Before/after engineering comparison |
| Layers | Exploded vertical stack: each layer separated and floating above the next, showing composition from top to bottom | Technology stack — UI layer, logic layer, data layer, infrastructure layer |
| Assembly | Single object exploded into components along assembly axis lines, each part labeled, showing how whole is constructed | Product assembly instructions — these parts in this order |
| Cutaway | Solid object with section removed, interior components visible and labeled, exterior context maintained | Engine cross-section — cylinder, piston, valves all visible |
| Network | Multiple isometric nodes (servers, devices, buildings) connected by routing lines across a gridded floor plane | Network topology — physical layout of connected systems |
| Zoomed detail | Main overview at smaller scale, inset showing zoomed-in isometric detail of a critical component | Technical drawing with detail callout — "see detail A" |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Isometric Technical Metaphor |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Data/information | Containers/boxes of proportional size, with capacity measured in cubic volume |
| Processes | Flow through connected isometric units — input enters, transformation happens, output exits |
| Systems | Multiple isometric components connected by visible pathways (pipes, cables, arrows) |
| Connections | Lines/pipes/cables linking isometric objects, routing clearly visible |
| Hierarchy | Vertical stacking: top layer = user-facing, bottom layer = infrastructure |
| Layers/abstraction | Exploded vertical separation, each layer hovering above the next with gap between |
| Components | Distinct isometric shapes (cubes, cylinders, custom forms) representing different part types |
| Assembly/composition | Exploded view with dotted alignment lines showing how parts fit together |
| Internal structure | Cutaway revealing interior components, section plane color-coded |
| Capacity/volume | Physical 3D size of isometric containers — larger box = more capacity |
| Flow/throughput | Pipes or arrows of proportional thickness, thicker = more flow |
| Status | Color-coded elements: green = active/healthy, red = error/critical, yellow = warning |
| Users/people | Small isometric human figures for scale, or workstations with chairs |
| Security/protection | Enclosing shells, walls, or barriers around protected components |

## Typography

- Technical sans-serif fonts: DIN, Eurostile, Roboto Mono, or similar — precise, engineered letterforms
- Monospace for part numbers, codes, and measurements — technical data should align in columns
- Labels in regular weight, connected to parts by leader lines with terminal dots or arrows
- Dimension text small and precise, positioned along dimension lines
- Uppercase for primary labels, mixed case for descriptive text
- Legend tables with clear headers and aligned columns
- Title block style for main headings: bold, technical, contained in a structured header area
- NO decorative fonts, NO serifs, NO hand-drawn styles — everything is engineered precision
- Numbers always in tabular figures for alignment

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT perspective drawing** — perspective has vanishing points where parallel lines converge. Isometric lines stay parallel. This is axonometric, not perspective
- **NOT a loose sketch or illustration** — isometric technical is precise, measured, and clean. No wobbly lines, no artistic expressiveness
- **NOT 3D rendered with lighting effects** — no glossy surfaces, no reflections, no ambient occlusion glow. This is diagrammatic, not photorealistic
- **NOT filled with decorative icons** — every element serves to explain structure or function. No cute icons, no emojis, no embellishments
- **NOT colorful infographic style** — color is functional (section fills, status indicators, callout emphasis), not decorative. Mostly grayscale with selective color
- **NOT an architectural render** — architectural renders are atmospheric and lifestyle-focused. This is clinical documentation
- **NOT a simple 2D diagram with 3D boxes** — the isometric view must be consistent throughout, with all elements following the same projection angles
- **NOT hand-drawn patent illustration style** — while patent drawings are related, this style is cleaner and more modern, digital rather than pen-and-ink
- This must look like documentation from a NASA systems manual or a precise engineering specification, not a creative infographic or marketing illustration
