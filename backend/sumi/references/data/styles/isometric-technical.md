# isometric-technical

Precise three-dimensional diagrams drawn at exact 30-degree axonometric angles — clean white surfaces with calculated shadow planes, cutaway sections revealing color-coded internals, exploded assemblies floating in perfect mathematical alignment along dashed trajectory lines, numbered callouts on leader lines pointing to every bolt and bracket. This is a NASA systems manual, a Haynes engine cross-section, a Siemens turbine specification — where bewildering complexity is rendered comprehensible through the disciplined geometry of parallel projection. No vanishing points. No artistic license. Every line serves documentation.

## Color Palette

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Blueprint Classic | White surfaces + charcoal edges + blueprint blue annotations + light gray shadows — the canonical technical documentation look |
| Engineering Manual | White + gray gradations + signal red callouts + safety yellow warnings — industrial reference manual aesthetic, Haynes guide energy |
| System Architecture | White + soft blue section fills + green status nodes + gray infrastructure + red failure indicators — data center and network diagram mode |
| Architectural Section | Warm white + cool gray shadows + black edge lines + pale orange and green section fills — building cutaway / structural documentation |
| Monochrome Precision | Pure white + three gray values only (#E5E7EB, #9CA3AF, #374151) + black outlines — maximum clarity, no color distraction |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Cutaway** | Revealed interior structure with section planes | External shell cleanly sliced away to expose internal components, section plane edge visible as a bold colored line, interior parts rendered in contrasting pale fill, exterior maintains full gray shading |
| **Exploded** | Separated components floating along assembly trajectories | Parts hovering apart along precisely aligned dashed axis lines, each component individually labeled with leader line and callout number, assembly order implied by spatial sequence |
| **System** | Multiple interconnected units with visible flow paths | Distinct isometric modules connected by routed pipes, cables, or directional arrows across a shared ground plane, flow direction indicated, status color-coded at each node |
| **Architectural** | Spatial structure with selective wall removal | Rooms, floors, corridors shown in true isometric, strategic walls removed or ghosted to reveal interior contents, furniture and equipment at correct scale, human figures for reference |
| **Layered Stack** | Vertical separation of conceptual layers | Each abstraction layer floating above the next with measured vertical gap, translucent connection lines between layers, top layer = user-facing, bottom layer = infrastructure |

## Visual Elements

- **True 30-degree isometric projection** — ALL horizontal lines at exactly 30 degrees to the page horizontal, ALL vertical lines perfectly vertical. Parallel lines remain parallel forever. This mathematical consistency is non-negotiable and the defining characteristic of the style
- **Consistent line weight hierarchy** — primary outlines 2px in dark charcoal, secondary structure 1px in medium gray, dimension lines 0.5px in blue, hidden/ghosted lines dashed at 1px in light gray
- **Three-value surface shading** — every isometric surface receives one of three gray values depending on its orientation to the consistent upper-left light source: top face lightest, front-right face medium, left face darkest
- **Cutaway section planes** — clean diagonal or horizontal cuts through solid objects, the cut edge marked with a bold colored line (blue or red), interior surfaces filled with a pale tinted wash distinct from exterior gray
- **Exploded view trajectory lines** — thin dashed lines or fine arrows showing the exact path each separated component travels to reach its assembled position, all trajectories parallel to isometric axes
- **Numbered callout system** — small circles containing sequential numbers (1, 2, 3...) connected by angled leader lines with terminal dots pointing to specific components, corresponding to a numbered legend
- **Dimension lines with terminals** — thin blue lines with small arrow or tick terminals marking measured distances, dimension value centered on the line in technical font
- **Component labels** — part identification codes (A-1, B-2, Module-3) in monospace technical font, connected by hairline leader lines
- **Grid patterns on surfaces** — faint ruled grids on floor planes and wall surfaces suggesting scale, material structure, or panel divisions
- **Transparent/ghosted elements** — components drawn with dashed outlines and no fill (or very light fill) to show hidden internal structure visible through solid exterior
- **Flow direction arrows** — filled triangular arrowheads on pipes, cables, and connection lines indicating direction of data, fluid, or energy movement
- **Status indicator nodes** — small circles or rounded rectangles at connection points, color-filled (green/yellow/red) to indicate system state
- **NO perspective convergence** — lines NEVER converge toward vanishing points. If parallel lines appear to meet, the projection is wrong
- **NO decorative embellishment** — every element serves an explanatory function. No icons, no illustrations, no ornament

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Vertical stack of isometric layers: most important/user-facing at top, supporting infrastructure descending below, each layer clearly separated with labeled connection points between them | Server architecture: UI at top, application logic middle, database bottom, hardware foundation |
| Flow/process | Left-to-right sequence of isometric stages connected by directional flow arrows, each stage showing the system at a distinct process phase, transformation visible between stages | Manufacturing line: raw input enters left, machining center, assembly zone, finished output exits right |
| Connections | Multiple distinct isometric units arrayed across a shared ground plane, connected by visible routed pipes/cables/lines with labeled flow direction and junction nodes | Network topology: server racks connected to switches connected to storage arrays |
| Comparison | Two isometric views at identical scale and angle placed side by side: version A vs. version B, or before vs. after, differences highlighted in accent color | Engineering change order: old design left, new design right, modifications in red |
| Layers/stack | Exploded vertical separation: each conceptual layer floating above the next with consistent measured gap, translucent vertical connection lines between layers showing dependencies | Technology stack: presentation layer, business logic, data access, infrastructure |
| Assembly | Single object exploded into individual components along isometric axis lines, parts sequenced by assembly order, each labeled with ID and leader line | Product assembly: frame first, then panels, then hardware, then accessories |
| Cutaway reveal | Complete exterior envelope with strategic section removed, interior components visible and individually labeled, section plane colored, exterior context maintained for orientation | Engine cross-section: cylinder block, pistons, valves, cooling channels all exposed |
| Network topology | Multiple isometric nodes (servers, devices, buildings) distributed across a gridded floor plane, routing lines between nodes following orthogonal paths, bandwidth/status indicated by line weight and color | Data center floor plan: rack locations, cable routing, cooling zones |
| Zoomed detail | Main overview rendered at small scale occupying 60% of frame, circular inset at 3x magnification showing critical component detail, leader line connecting inset to location in overview | Technical drawing convention: "See Detail A" with magnified callout |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Isometric Technical Metaphor |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Data/information | Isometric containers (cubes, cylinders, tanks) of proportional volume — larger container = more data |
| Processes | Sequential flow through connected isometric units: input pipe enters module, transformation occurs within, output pipe exits |
| Systems | Multiple isometric components on shared ground plane, interconnected by visible routed pathways |
| Connections | Pipes, cables, or arrows linking isometric objects with clear routing paths and labeled junctions |
| Growth | Progressive size increase along an axis: small container grows to medium grows to large, or stacking of additional layers |
| Time | Left-to-right flow progression, or numbered sequential stations along a process line |
| Hierarchy | Vertical stacking: top layer = user-facing/important, bottom layer = foundational infrastructure |
| Layers/abstraction | Exploded vertical separation with measured gaps between floating layers |
| Components | Distinct isometric shapes representing different types: cubes for storage, cylinders for processing, flat planes for interfaces |
| Assembly/composition | Exploded view with dashed alignment trajectories showing how separated parts converge to assembled whole |
| Internal structure | Cutaway section revealing interior components that are normally hidden by exterior shell |
| Capacity/volume | Physical 3D size of isometric containers — cubic volume directly maps to capacity |
| Flow/throughput | Pipe or arrow thickness proportional to volume of flow — thicker pipe = more throughput |
| Status/health | Color-coded indicators at nodes: green = active/healthy, yellow = warning/degraded, red = error/critical |
| Users/people | Small isometric human figures (approximately 1.8m at scale) placed for size reference, or isometric workstations with chairs |
| Security/protection | Enclosing shells, walls, or barrier planes surrounding protected components, drawn with thicker outlines |

## Typography

- Technical sans-serif faces: DIN, Eurostile, Barlow, IBM Plex Sans, or Roboto — precise, engineered, zero personality
- Monospace for part numbers, component codes, IP addresses, and measurements: IBM Plex Mono, Roboto Mono, or Fira Code — data must align in columns
- Labels in regular weight, connected to components by angled leader lines terminating in small filled dots or arrows
- Dimension text small and precise (typically 7-8pt equivalent), centered on or offset from dimension lines, always horizontal regardless of line angle
- Uppercase for primary system labels (MODULE A, CONTROLLER, PRIMARY DB), mixed case for descriptive annotations
- Legend tables with clear header rows, consistent column widths, and alternating-row shading for readability
- Title block formatting for main headings: bold weight, enclosed in a structured header band at top of composition
- NO decorative fonts, NO serifs, NO handwritten or script faces — pure engineered precision
- Tabular figures always, never proportional numerals — numbers must align vertically in columns

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT perspective drawing** — perspective uses vanishing points where parallel lines converge toward the horizon. Isometric lines stay parallel to infinity. If horizontal parallels converge, the projection is wrong. This is axonometric, never perspective.
- **NOT a loose sketch or concept illustration** — isometric technical is mathematically precise, measured, and clean. No wobbly lines, no artistic stroke variation, no watercolor or pencil texture. Every line is ruled.
- **NOT 3D rendered with lighting effects** — no glossy specular highlights, no reflections, no ambient occlusion glow, no subsurface scattering. This is diagrammatic documentation, not Cinema 4D output.
- **NOT kawaii or cute** — no rounded friendly shapes, no pastel colors for aesthetics, no smiling faces on devices. Every element is clinical and functional.
- **NOT a colorful marketing infographic** — color is functional and sparing: gray for structure, blue for dimensions, red for warnings, green for status. Not decorative rainbow palettes.
- **NOT architectural visualization** — arch-viz renders are atmospheric, lifestyle-focused, with plants and people and golden-hour lighting. This is clinical system documentation.
- **NOT a 2D diagram with 3D-ish boxes** — the isometric projection must be mathematically consistent throughout, all elements following identical 30-degree angles. Inconsistent angles destroy the illusion.
- **NOT patent drawing style** — while related, patent drawings use crosshatch shading, dense reference numerals, and a hand-drafted pen-and-ink quality. Isometric technical is cleaner, more modern, digitally precise.
- **NOT IKEA manual** — IKEA instructions use simplified three-quarter views, faceless figures, and minimal annotation focused on consumer assembly. Isometric technical is rigorous engineering documentation with full annotation systems.
- This must look like it came from a NASA technical manual, a Rolls-Royce engine maintenance specification, or a Cisco network architecture document — precise, authoritative, and exhaustively annotated.

## Best For

System architecture documentation, technical explanations requiring 3D spatial clarity, product assembly and maintenance specifications, data center and infrastructure diagrams, process flow documentation with spatial relationships, engineering specifications, how-it-works breakdowns of complex machinery, component hierarchies, network topology visualization, anywhere that benefits from precise three-dimensional diagrammatic clarity and the authority of technical documentation.
