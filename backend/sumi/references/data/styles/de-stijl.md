# de-stijl

Thick black lines slicing the canvas into an asymmetric grid of rectangles — most left pure white, a few filled with flat saturated red, flat saturated blue, or flat saturated yellow. No curves anywhere. No diagonals (in the Mondrian mode). No shading, no texture, no illusion of depth. Just a bold black scaffold holding rectangles of primary color and white in a tense, asymmetric equilibrium that somehow feels both rigorous and alive. This is Piet Mondrian's Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow made into an information design language — Neoplasticism as visual communication.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Pure red (#FF0000), pure blue (#0000FF), pure yellow (#FFD700) — the three Neoplastic primaries, no mixing, no tinting, no shading
- Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF) — the dominant surface, most rectangles are white. White is not a neutral; it is an active compositional element
- Structure: True black (#000000) — thick straight lines forming the grid. Black is load-bearing architecture, not decoration
- Neutrals: Medium gray (#808080) used sparingly in the Van Doesburg variant for diagonal compositions only

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Classic Mondrian | White dominant + black grid + one red rectangle + one blue rectangle + one small yellow rectangle — the canonical composition, more white than color, asymmetric balance |
| Bold Primary | Equal areas of red, blue, yellow divided by thick black grid — more saturated, less white, bolder impact. Closer to a Rietveld chair than a Mondrian painting |
| Minimal | White + black grid + single small red rectangle — maximum restraint, the red accent a startling punctuation mark in a field of white and black |
| Van Doesburg Diagonal | Same primaries but the entire grid rotated 45 degrees — diamonds instead of rectangles, dynamic diagonal energy breaking Mondrian's horizontal-vertical rule |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Mondrian** | Classic horizontal-vertical grid with asymmetric color placement | Thick black lines creating an uneven grid of rectangles. Most rectangles pure white. A large red rectangle anchoring one corner, a smaller blue rectangle in the opposite area, a tiny yellow rectangle as accent. The asymmetry is deliberate — nothing centered, nothing symmetrical, yet everything balanced through visual weight |
| **Rietveld** | Architectural, furniture-like, more color saturation | Inspired by the Red-Blue Chair and Schroder House. More colored rectangles, less white. Colors extend to edges, planes overlap and extend past the frame. The grid becomes three-dimensional scaffolding — red horizontal planes, blue vertical planes, yellow accent bars, all connected by black structural lines |
| **Van Doesburg** | Diagonal counter-compositions with dynamic rotational energy | The entire Mondrian grid tilted 45 degrees. Diamond-shaped canvas (or compositions that feel diamond-shaped). Rectangles become diamonds, the stable grid becomes dynamic and vertiginous. Colors are the same three primaries but the diagonal thrust adds movement Mondrian deliberately avoided |
| **Boogie Woogie** | Dense rhythmic grids with color replacing black lines | Inspired by Mondrian's late New York period. The thick black grid lines are replaced by lines made of tiny alternating colored squares — red-yellow-blue-red-yellow pulsing along the grid like city lights. More color, more rhythm, more energy. Small colored rectangles scattered at intersections like musical notes |

## Visual Elements

- **Thick black straight lines** — bold horizontal and vertical bars (6-10px weight) dividing the canvas into an irregular grid of rectangles. Lines extend from edge to edge of the composition. The thickness gives them physical presence — they are structural beams, not thin dividers
- **Flat primary-color rectangles** — shapes filled with a single unmodulated primary color (red, blue, or yellow). No gradient, no shading, no texture within the fill. The color is absolute — it does not vary from corner to corner of the rectangle
- **Dominant white space** — most rectangles in the grid are pure white. Color is used sparingly and strategically. The white rectangles are not empty; they are positive compositional elements holding their own visual weight
- **Asymmetric balance** — nothing is centered, nothing is symmetrically placed, yet the composition feels balanced. A large red rectangle in the upper right is counterweighted by a small blue rectangle in the lower left. The balance is achieved through color weight, not geometric symmetry
- **Only horizontal and vertical lines** — NO curves, NO diagonals (except in the Van Doesburg variant), NO circles, NO organic shapes. Every edge is either horizontal or vertical, creating a strict orthogonal world
- **Lines extend to canvas edges** — grid lines run all the way to the border, suggesting the composition continues beyond the frame. The grid is a window into an infinite plane, not a contained design
- **Rectangles of varying proportions** — tall narrow rectangles next to wide short ones, large areas of white next to small squares of color. The variety of rectangle proportions creates visual rhythm within the strict orthogonal system
- **Color used as punctuation** — in a field of white and black, a red rectangle is like a shout. Color draws the eye immediately. The placement of each colored rectangle is a deliberate compositional decision, not decoration
- **NO rounded corners, NO circles, NO triangles** — the only shape is the rectangle (including the square as a special case). If any curved or non-rectangular shape appears, it is wrong
- **NO gradients, NO shadows, NO 3D effects** — this is pure flat abstraction. There is no light source, no depth, no atmosphere
- **NO decorative elements** — no patterns within rectangles, no textures, no ornament of any kind. Each surface is pure, uninterrupted color or white
- **Black line intersections** — where horizontal and vertical black lines cross, they form a thick black junction. These intersections are structural nodes in the grid

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Largest colored rectangle = most important, progressively smaller colored rectangles for lesser items, all within the black grid. The biggest red rectangle holds the main idea; smaller blue and yellow rectangles hold supporting points | Mondrian's Composition — large red plane dominates, smaller color planes subordinate |
| Flow/process | Horizontal reading direction through a sequence of grid cells, left to right. Each step occupies one grid rectangle, steps connected by the shared black grid lines. Color intensifies as the process progresses (white to yellow to red) | A Mondrian grid read as a timeline from left edge to right edge |
| Connections | Shared black grid lines connecting adjacent rectangles — two items are connected if they share a grid line boundary. The grid itself IS the relationship map | The black scaffold connecting all planes in a Mondrian composition |
| Cycles | The Boogie Woogie variant — pulsing colored squares along grid lines that loop around the composition, the rhythm cycling back to the beginning | Broadway Boogie Woogie's pulsing colored grid lines |
| Comparison | Left half vs. right half of the grid — one side dominated by red rectangles, the other by blue rectangles, separated by a thick central vertical black line | Split Mondrian composition — warm vs. cool zones |
| Categories | Each category assigned a primary color — red items, blue items, yellow items — arranged within their own regions of the grid, separated by black lines | Color-coded regions in the Mondrian grid |
| Growth | Rectangles increasing in size from bottom-left to top-right, each step adding more color. Smallest white rectangle at origin growing to largest red rectangle at terminus | Expanding grid cells suggesting growth across the plane |
| Networks | Dense grid with colored rectangles at nodes (intersections where important grid lines cross), white rectangles as pathways between nodes | Boogie Woogie intersection dots as network nodes |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | De Stijl Metaphor |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Data/information | Size of the colored rectangle — more data = larger rectangle, more important = red, secondary = blue, tertiary = yellow |
| Processes | Horizontal sequence of grid cells, reading left to right, color intensifying with each step |
| Systems | The entire black grid structure — every element connected, every line load-bearing, the system is the scaffold itself |
| Connections | Shared grid line boundaries between adjacent rectangles — physical adjacency within the orthogonal structure |
| Growth | Expanding rectangle size across the composition, from small white square to large red rectangle |
| Time | Left-to-right horizontal progression through grid cells — past is white, present is yellow, future is red |
| Hierarchy | Visual weight of color: red is heaviest (most important), blue is medium, yellow is lightest, white is neutral. Size reinforces: largest rectangle = highest rank |
| Protection | A colored rectangle fully enclosed within larger black grid lines — the grid is the protective structure |
| Speed | The Boogie Woogie pulsing line — small colored squares alternating rapidly along a grid line, like city lights flashing past |
| Stability | The thick black orthogonal grid itself — perfectly horizontal, perfectly vertical, immovable, structural |
| Users/people | Colored rectangles of proportional size — each person represented by a rectangle, color indicating role or category |
| Ideas | A single colored rectangle (especially yellow — the lightest, most luminous primary) appearing in a field of white — a bright idea in an empty space |
| Energy | Red rectangles — red carries the most visual weight and warmth, multiple red rectangles in a composition create energy and urgency |
| Tension/conflict | Large red rectangle pressing against large blue rectangle with only a thick black line between them — opposing forces held in equilibrium by the grid structure |

## Typography

- Clean geometric sans-serif — Futura, Helvetica, or similar. Rectangular letterforms that echo the grid's orthogonal discipline
- Bold weight for titles and labels — medium weight for body text. The weight hierarchy is simple: bold or not-bold, no in-between
- Text is always horizontal — never rotated, never curved, never diagonal (except in Van Doesburg variant where text may sit at 45 degrees)
- Text sits within grid rectangles, aligned to the grid lines. Labels are part of the composition, not floating above it
- Color text only in the three primaries or black — red, blue, or yellow text on white rectangles, or white/black text on colored rectangles
- Letter-spacing is slightly wide, giving each letter its own rectangular space within the grid rhythm
- NO serif faces, NO script, NO decorative typography, NO hand-lettered quality — the type must feel as precise and geometric as the grid itself
- Titles can be set in all-caps with generous tracking, becoming horizontal bands within the grid structure

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT Bauhaus** — Bauhaus (existing style) uses circles, triangles, diagonal sweeping lines, colored halos, overlapping translucent planes, and Kandinsky's musical-geometric energy. De Stijl uses ONLY rectangles, ONLY horizontal and vertical lines, ONLY flat opaque primary fills. If there is a circle, a triangle, a diagonal line, or overlapping translucent colors, it is wrong. De Stijl is far more restrictive than Bauhaus.
- **NOT bold-graphic** — Bold Graphic is a modern corporate style with flexible shapes and a broad color range. De Stijl is a strict historical art movement with exactly three colors plus black and white. If it looks like a contemporary infographic that happens to use primary colors, it is wrong.
- **NOT Memphis** — Memphis (existing style) is deliberately chaotic, clashing, pattern-filled, with zigzags, squiggles, terrazzo, and dozens of loud colors. De Stijl is the opposite: rigorous, harmonious, pattern-free, with exactly three colors. If it looks playful, chaotic, or decorated, it is wrong.
- **NOT a pie chart or bar graph in primary colors** — De Stijl is not a color scheme applied to conventional data visualization. The grid IS the visualization. If you can swap the colors for any other palette and the composition still works the same, the De Stijl structure is missing.
- **NOT a Rubik's cube or toy block pattern** — the grid must be ASYMMETRIC. If the rectangles are uniform in size or arranged in a regular repeating pattern, it is wrong. Mondrian spent weeks adjusting the proportions of each rectangle. The irregularity is the art.
- **NOT pixel art or a digital grid** — though both use rectangular cells, pixel art implies digital screens and 8-bit nostalgia. De Stijl implies fine art, architecture, and philosophical abstraction. The thick black lines are painted beams, not pixel borders.
- **NOT a colorful window pane or stained glass** — stained glass uses thin lead lines and a full rainbow of colors. De Stijl uses thick black lines and ONLY red, blue, yellow, white, and black. No green, no orange, no purple, no pink.
- This must look like a Piet Mondrian painting brought to life as information architecture — thick black structural lines holding asymmetric rectangles of primary color and white in a tense, deliberate equilibrium. Not a colorful grid; an abstract composition where every line and every color placement carries meaning.

## Best For

Organizational structures, system architectures, category taxonomies, comparison frameworks, hierarchy diagrams, any content that benefits from rigorous visual structure, clear categorical color-coding (three categories map perfectly to three primaries), and the authority of geometric abstraction — content where the structure IS the message.
