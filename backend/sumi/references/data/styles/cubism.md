# cubism

Fractured planes and multiple perspectives colliding on a single canvas — Picasso and Braque dismantling reality into geometric facets, showing you the front, side, and back of an object simultaneously. Angular shards of muted earth tones and grays intersecting at sharp angles, objects deconstructed into overlapping triangles, trapezoids, and fragmented curves. This is seeing through time, around corners, inside and outside at once. The guitar becomes twenty guitars. The face shows both eyes from the front while the nose juts sideways. Analytical precision meeting synthetic boldness, newspaper collage mixing with oil paint, the flat picture plane asserting itself against any illusion of depth.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Muted earth tones — ochre (#C4A35A), raw sienna (#D68A59), burnt umber (#6E4B3A), olive (#6B7B3A)
- Neutrals: Warm grays (#8B8178), cool grays (#6B7280), charcoal (#3A3A3A), parchment (#E8DCC8)
- Accents: Muted blue (#4A6A8A), terracotta (#B85C38), dusty rose (#B87A7A), forest green (#4A5A3A)
- Background: Warm tan (#D4C4A8), gray-brown (#9A8A7A), or fragmented planes of multiple earth tones
- Text: Charcoal black (#2A2A2A) or white reversed out of dark planes
- Collage: Newsprint texture (#E8E4D8), faux wood grain (#A08060), musical notation fragments

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Analytical | Grays + browns + single ochre accent — the monochromatic phase of early Cubism, form over color |
| Synthetic | Ochre + blue + terracotta + black outlines — bolder color planes of later Cubism with collage elements |
| Collage | Newsprint cream + charcoal + single bright accent (red or blue) — papier collé aesthetic |
| Portrait | Flesh ochre + gray shadows + blue-black hair + warm background — the Cubist figure study palette |
| Still Life | Browns + greens + tan + newspaper texture — the classic guitar and bottle on table |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Analytical** | Objects broken into countless small facets, near-monochromatic | Dense overlapping planes in grays and browns, objects barely recognizable, form fragmented to the edge of abstraction, multiple viewpoints compressed |
| **Synthetic** | Bolder shapes, flatter planes, collage elements | Larger geometric shapes, brighter colors, newspaper and pattern textures, objects more recognizable but still multi-perspective |
| **Portrait** | Human face/figure shown from multiple angles simultaneously | Both eyes facing forward, nose in profile, fragmented features reassembled geometrically, the face as constructed object |
| **Still Life** | Classic table-top arrangements — guitars, bottles, fruit, newspapers | Musical instruments and everyday objects shattered and reconstructed, strong diagonal table edge, overlapping transparent planes |

## Visual Elements

- **Fragmented geometric planes** — objects broken into angular facets (triangles, trapezoids, irregular polygons) that overlap and intersect, each plane a different viewing angle
- **Multiple simultaneous perspectives** — the same object shown from front, side, top at once, viewpoints collapsed onto a single picture plane
- **Overlapping transparent planes** — shapes layered so edges pass through each other, creating ambiguous spatial relationships, figure and ground interchangeable
- **Strong angular lines** — diagonal edges cutting across the composition, creating dynamic tension and fragmenting forms
- **Muted tonal gradations within planes** — subtle shading from light to dark within each facet, suggesting volume while remaining flat
- **Collage elements** — newspaper clippings, sheet music, faux wood grain, text fragments integrated into the painted surface
- **Heavy dark outlines** — some edges emphasized with thick charcoal lines, others left ambiguous and melting into adjacent planes
- **Passage** — planes bleeding into each other at their edges, boundaries deliberately blurred, forms breathing into the surrounding space
- **Stenciled letters and numbers** — typography fragments scattered through the composition, industrial and found elements
- **Textured paint surface** — visible brushwork, sand mixed into paint, material presence asserting the flatness of the canvas

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Central dominant form fragmenting outward, largest facets at core, smaller fragments at periphery | Portrait with face as central mass radiating angular shards |
| Flow/process | Diagonal movement across overlapping planes, steps as adjacent facets progressing left-to-right | Fragmented timeline, each moment a different angular view |
| Connections | Shared edges where planes meet, lines passing through multiple objects, visual rhymes between shapes | Guitar neck continuing into arm continuing into table edge |
| Cycles | Circular arrangement of facets around a center point, rotation through perspectives | Object seen from 360 degrees compressed into radial composition |
| Comparison | Vertical or diagonal division with contrasting fragmentations on each side | Two subjects shattered in parallel, comparison through juxtaposition |
| Categories | Each category a different texture or color temperature within the same fractured visual system | Collage zones distinguishing newspaper, wood, musical notation |
| Complexity | Maximum fragmentation, densest overlapping planes, most viewpoints compressed | Analytical Cubism at its most abstract, form nearly dissolved |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Cubist Metaphor |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Data/information | Density of fragmentation — more facets = more information, fewer larger planes = simplified |
| Processes | Sequential facets showing transformation, object morphing through angular stages |
| Systems | Interlocking planes where every fragment connects and supports adjacent fragments |
| Connections | Shared edges and continuous lines passing through multiple forms |
| Growth | Expansion outward from a tight central core to larger peripheral fragments |
| Time | Multiple moments compressed into one image, before and after simultaneously visible |
| Hierarchy | Central position and larger plane size indicates importance |
| Analysis | Maximum fragmentation, object broken into smallest comprehensible components |
| Synthesis | Larger planes reassembled into recognizable whole, collage elements unified |
| Users/people | Fragmented portraits showing personality from multiple psychological angles |
| Ideas | Abstract geometric forms emerging from concrete objects |
| Complexity | Density of intersecting planes, number of simultaneous perspectives |

## Typography

- Industrial stencil letterforms — UPPERCASE letters painted or collaged, as if from shipping crates or newspapers
- Typography as found object — letters and words are physical fragments incorporated into the composition, not floating labels
- Partial words acceptable — fragments of newspaper headlines, torn edges, letters cut off by plane boundaries
- Serif faces for newspaper fragments, bold sans-serif for stenciled elements
- Text follows the angular orientations of surrounding planes — tilted, fragmented, multi-directional
- Numbers and letters as geometric forms in their own right, contributing to the visual rhythm

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT clean or precise** — Cubism is rough, textured, and handmade. No vector precision, no perfect geometry, no digital cleanliness.
- **NOT colorful** — early Cubism is nearly monochromatic; even Synthetic Cubism uses muted, earthy tones. No bright primaries, no saturated hues.
- **NOT abstract expressionism** — Cubism maintains recognizable subjects, however fragmented. There is always a guitar, a face, a bottle. It is not pure abstraction.
- **NOT symmetrical** — compositions are dynamic and asymmetrical, with tension between competing planes and perspectives.
- **NOT smooth gradients** — shading within planes is subtle and painterly, not airbrushed or digitally blended.
- **NOT Art Deco** — Art Deco stylizes and simplifies; Cubism fragments and multiplies. Deco is decorative; Cubism is analytical.
- **NOT isometric or technical** — despite being geometric, Cubism deliberately rejects single-point perspective and technical drawing conventions.
- This must look like a Picasso or Braque painting — fractured, earthy, intellectually rigorous, materially present — not a geometric illustration that happens to use angular shapes.

## Best For

Complex analytical topics, multi-perspective explanations, deconstructing systems into components, showing relationships between parts and wholes, intellectual and artistic subjects, historical and cultural content, topics requiring multiple viewpoints, sophisticated audiences comfortable with abstraction.
