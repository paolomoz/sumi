# cubism

Fractured, crystalline planes depicting subjects from multiple simultaneous viewpoints — a face seen from the front and profile at once, objects shattered into angular facets like a broken mirror reflecting reality from every angle. Muted earth tones of ochre, gray, and brown with sharp geometric edges colliding and overlapping, creating spatial ambiguity where foreground and background merge into a single flattened, fragmented surface. This is Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, Braque's Houses at l'Estaque, Gris's still lifes — reality deconstructed and reassembled as interlocking geometric shards.

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Analytical Cubism | Raw umber + slate gray + ochre + charcoal brown on parchment — the classic Braque/Picasso 1910-12 palette, nearly monochromatic, all planes merging |
| Synthetic Cubism | Ochre + dusty terracotta + muted teal + faded blue-gray — slightly more color contrast, flatter planes, collage-like layering |
| Gris Still Life | Slate gray + pale rose + olive + burnt sienna on warm beige — Juan Gris's more elegant, decorative cubist palette |
| High Contrast | Deep charcoal + ochre yellow + cream white — dramatic dark-light fragmentation with minimal color, maximum tonal contrast |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Analytical** | Monochromatic shattered facets, barely-there color | Nearly identical earth tones — umber, gray, ochre — with differences so subtle they merge, forms fragmenting into dozens of small angular planes, deep spatial ambiguity |
| **Synthetic** | Flatter collage-like planes, more distinct color areas | Larger geometric shapes with cleaner edges, areas of pattern (wood grain, newspaper texture), overlapping flat planes like cut paper |
| **Portrait** | Faces and figures fractured across multiple viewpoints | Eyes at different angles, profiles merged with frontal views, features scattered across angular facets — a face deconstructed into geometric shards |
| **Still Life** | Objects on tables broken into interlocking planes | Guitars, bottles, fruit bowls, newspapers — recognizable subjects shattered and reassembled, tablecloth folds becoming geometric facets |

## Visual Elements

- **Fragmented angular planes** — subjects shattered into dozens of interlocking triangular, trapezoidal, and irregular polygonal facets, each plane a slightly different tone
- **Simultaneous multiple viewpoints** — objects rendered as if seen from front, side, and above all at once, then compressed onto a single flat surface
- **Overlapping transparent planes** — geometric facets that seem to pass through each other, creating ambiguous depth where forms interpenetrate
- **Subtle tonal gradation within planes** — each facet shaded to suggest volume, but the shading contradicts adjacent planes, confusing spatial logic
- **Sharp angular edges** — no soft curves, everything reduced to straight lines meeting at angles, even organic forms become geometric
- **Newspaper/text fragments** — collaged or painted letters, words, sheet music notation scattered across the composition
- **Wood grain and faux texture patterns** — trompe l'oeil wood graining, dotted patterns, striped sections adding surface interest to flat planes
- **Thick dark outlines** — some edges emphasized with heavy brown or black lines, others left soft and ambiguous
- **Passages** — areas where planes open into each other, forms deliberately unfinished to let the eye move through
- **Shallow compressed space** — no deep perspective, everything pushed toward the picture plane into a shallow relief
- **Stenciled letters and numbers** — crisp typographic elements floating among the fractured forms
- **Still life objects** — guitars, wine glasses, bottles, fruit bowls, pipes, newspapers as recurring subject motifs

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Central dominant form fractured into largest planes, peripheral elements shattered into smaller, denser facets | Picasso's Portrait of Ambroise Vollard — face assembled from central facets radiating outward |
| Flow/process | Diagonal progression of overlapping planes moving across the composition, each stage a new layer of fragmentation | Forms cascading diagonally like a shattered mirror's reflections |
| Connections | Angular faceted lines linking fragmented elements, relationships shown through shared edges and overlapping planes | Braque's violin paintings — parts connected through adjacent facets |
| Cycles | Circular arrangement of faceted forms rotating around a central point, each segment a different angle on the same subject | Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase implied cycle of motion |
| Comparison | Split composition with the same subject fragmented differently on each side — analytical vs. synthetic, tight vs. loose | Left and right halves showing two cubist interpretations |
| Categories | Each category represented by a different fragmented object — guitar for music, bottle for drink — arranged in a still life grouping | Gris's tabletop arrangements with multiple fragmented objects |
| Growth | Progressive fragmentation from intact form at one edge to fully shattered planes at the other | Evolution from recognizable to abstract across the composition |
| Networks | Multiple fragmented nodes connected through shared facet edges, the background itself fragmented into connecting planes | Web of interlocking angular forms where negative space is equally fragmented |
| Timeline | Horizontal band of increasingly fragmented forms, each moment more shattered than the last | Time as progressive deconstruction of stable form |
| Parts-to-whole | Large form assembled from smaller recognizable fragments — the whole emerges from the broken pieces | Portrait emerging from dozens of overlapping angular shards |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Cubism Metaphor |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Data/information | Fragmented planes of different sizes — larger planes for major data, tiny facets for details, all interlocking |
| Processes | Angular faceted path through the composition, each stage a different fragment angle on the subject |
| Systems | Interlocking planes that share edges, the whole emerging from precisely fitted geometric shards |
| Connections | Shared facet boundaries where one form's edge becomes another's, overlap zones where planes interpenetrate |
| Growth | Progressive fragmentation — intact form shattering into increasing numbers of facets |
| Time | Multiple moments collapsed into single image, the same subject seen from sequential viewpoints simultaneously |
| Hierarchy | Larger, more defined planes for important elements; smaller, denser fragmentation for secondary content |
| Protection | Enclosing angular boundary of faceted planes, content inside the shattered frame |
| Speed | Diagonal thrust of angular planes cascading in one direction, motion through fragmented space |
| Stability | Large anchoring faceted form at composition base, smaller fragments radiating from stable center |
| Users/people | Faces and figures constructed from angular facets — eyes, noses, mouths scattered across geometric planes, features seen from multiple angles simultaneously |
| Ideas | Light-toned facets radiating from a bright center, illumination fragmenting outward |
| Energy | Dense clustering of small sharp facets, aggressive angular collision of planes |
| Tension/conflict | Opposing facet directions clashing at a jagged boundary, warm tones vs. cool tones in adjacent planes |
| Complexity | Denser fragmentation with more facets per area, layered overlapping planes creating visual density |

## Typography

- Angular, geometric sans-serif faces that echo the faceted forms
- Letters can fragment across plane boundaries — a word broken by a facet edge
- Stenciled, industrial letterforms like those Braque and Picasso painted into their works
- Text as visual element — newspaper fragments, isolated letters, partial words
- Titles placed within angular faceted boxes that continue the cubist fragmentation
- Muted brown, gray, or ochre text colors that harmonize with the earth-tone palette
- Headlines can split across multiple planes at different angles
- NO decorative scripts, NO rounded friendly faces — typography must feel angular and constructed

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT abstract geometric art** — Cubism depicts recognizable subjects (faces, objects, figures) that have been fragmented, not pure abstract shapes. If you cannot identify any subject, it is wrong.
- **NOT a scattered collage of random shapes** — the fragments must fit together with precision, sharing edges, creating a unified but shattered whole. Random floating triangles are not cubism.
- **NOT bright or saturated colors** — Cubism uses muted earth tones, near-monochromatic palettes. Hot pink, electric blue, or vivid colors belong to other movements.
- **NOT clean flat design** — Cubism has subtle tonal gradation, texture, and spatial ambiguity. Flat solid color fills are too simple.
- **NOT symmetrical or orderly** — the fragmentation should feel complex, dense, and spatially confusing, not neatly organized.
- **NOT smooth curves** — Cubism is angular, all straight edges and sharp corners, even when depicting organic subjects.
- **NOT deep perspective space** — everything should feel compressed toward the picture plane, shallow and relief-like, not receding into depth.
- **NOT Bauhaus or geometric abstraction** — those are about pure form and color relationships. Cubism is about fragmenting and reassembling recognizable reality.
- This must look like Picasso and Braque's analytical cubism — muted colors, angular facets, recognizable subjects shattered into geometric planes, spatial ambiguity — not a modern geometric design exercise.

## Reference Images

- Note: Reference images for palette and texture should be sourced from art history resources showing Picasso, Braque, and Gris cubist works from 1908-1914

## Best For

Complex systems with interconnected parts, multi-perspective analysis, showing different viewpoints simultaneously, deconstructing complex subjects into components, intellectual and analytical content, art and design topics, anything that benefits from visual complexity, fragmentation metaphors, or multiple simultaneous perspectives on a single subject.
