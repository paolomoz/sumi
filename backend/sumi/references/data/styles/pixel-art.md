# pixel-art

The deliberate aesthetic of limited resolution — every single pixel placed with intention, no anti-aliasing, no gradients, just pure squares of color creating form through careful dithering and the magic of your brain filling in the details. This is the visual language of 8-bit and 16-bit video games, demoscene artistry, and modern indie games that choose constraint over convenience. Sharp edges, limited palettes, and the distinctive charm of seeing the grid. Whether it's the warm nostalgia of NES sprites or the sophisticated pixel paintings of modern masters, this style turns technical limitation into artistic virtue.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Bold, saturated game colors — Mario red (#E52521), Link green (#00A651), Sonic blue (#0066FF), Pac-Man yellow (#FFE135)
- Retro console: NES palette limitations — warm oranges (#F89820), teals (#00A8A8), purples (#7F00FF), the specific colors of 8-bit hardware
- Skin tones: Limited stepped values — light (#FFD8B8), medium (#E8A878), shadow (#C87858), following strict palette rules
- Background: Sky blue (#5C94FC), black (#000000), dark blue (#000040), or the specific background colors of classic games
- Outlines: Pure black (#000000) or darkest palette color for sprite definition
- Highlights: Pure white (#FFFFFF) or lightest palette color, placed as single pixels for shine

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| NES Classic | Limited 4-color sprite palette — black, two mid-tones, white/highlight — the hardware limitation as aesthetic |
| 16-bit Rich | Expanded SNES/Genesis palette — more gradual color ramps, 16-32 colors max, but still distinctly stepped |
| Game Boy | Four shades of green (#0F380F, #306230, #8BAC0F, #9BBC0F) — the iconic monochrome handheld look |
| CGA Retro | Cyan, magenta, white, black — the harsh early PC palette as deliberate aesthetic choice |
| Modern Pixel | Carefully curated 32-64 color palette with smooth ramps, sophisticated but still visibly stepped |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **8-bit** | Extreme limitation, chunky pixels, minimal colors | Large visible pixels, 4-8 colors maximum, simple iconic forms, NES/Game Boy aesthetic |
| **16-bit** | More refined sprites, richer color ramps, detailed scenes | Medium pixel density, 16-32 colors, more sophisticated dithering, SNES/Genesis era polish |
| **Isometric** | 3D space represented in pixel art, city builders and strategy games | 2:1 isometric projection, tile-based construction, detailed buildings and landscapes |
| **Portrait** | Character close-ups with careful color placement | Larger canvas focused on face/figure, subtle dithering for form, expressive within constraints |
| **Scene** | Full environment illustration with multiple elements | Layered backgrounds, foreground sprites, atmospheric depth through limited palette |

## Visual Elements

- **Visible pixel grid** — every element constructed on a clear grid, no sub-pixel rendering, no smoothing, edges are stepped not curved
- **Limited color palettes** — strict restrictions (4, 16, 32 colors) with smooth ramps between values, every color intentional
- **Dithering patterns** — checkerboard and patterned arrangements of two colors creating the illusion of intermediate tones
- **Single-pixel highlights** — tiny white or bright dots placed precisely to indicate shine, reflection, light source
- **Black or dark outlines** — sprites defined by crisp single-pixel outlines separating forms from background
- **Stepped gradients** — color transitions that jump between distinct values rather than smooth blending
- **Tile patterns** — repeated elements for backgrounds and textures, the building blocks of game environments
- **Animation frames** — static images implying movement, the visual vocabulary of sprite animation
- **Selective detail** — faces suggested with minimal pixels, expression conveyed through few dots, less is more
- **Cluster technique** — groups of same-colored pixels forming shapes, avoiding single isolated pixels (except highlights)

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Larger sprites for important elements, smaller for secondary, size = significance within pixel constraints | Main character sprite vs. background NPCs |
| Flow/process | Left-to-right progression like a side-scrolling game, steps as distinct screens or zones | Level progression, world map showing journey |
| Connections | Lines of pixels connecting elements, or implied connection through shared visual space | Platformer level showing traversable paths |
| Cycles | Circular arrangement or implied animation loop, frames suggesting continuous motion | Day/night cycle, seasonal progression, animation sprite sheet |
| Comparison | Side-by-side sprite comparison, before/after states, or split-screen game aesthetic | Character select screen, item comparison |
| Categories | Grid of sprites, inventory-style arrangement, each category a distinct pixel icon | Item inventory, character roster, ability icons |
| Growth | Sprites increasing in size/complexity, evolution shown through progressive detail | Pokemon evolution, power-up progression |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Pixel Art Metaphor |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Data/information | Sprite size or detail level — larger/more detailed sprites = more important data |
| Processes | Side-scrolling level layout, left-to-right progression through zones |
| Systems | Tile-based grid where elements connect and interact, game board aesthetic |
| Connections | Platform paths, connecting pipes, visual routes between sprites |
| Growth | Size increase, detail increase, color palette expansion |
| Time | Animation frames, day/night palette shift, sprite state changes |
| Hierarchy | Sprite scale — bosses are bigger, power-ups glow, protagonists are detailed |
| Protection | Shield sprites, wall tiles, enclosed safe zones |
| Speed | Horizontal stretch, motion lines, speed dithering blur |
| Stability | Solid platform tiles, grounded sprites, symmetrical structures |
| Users/people | Character sprites with recognizable silhouettes and expressions |
| Ideas | Thought bubble sprites, light bulb icon, exclamation point |
| Energy | Glowing effects (limited palette glow), pulsing animation implied, bright accent colors |
| Achievement | Trophy sprites, star icons, completion checkmarks |

## Typography

- Pixel fonts with strict grid adherence — every letterform built on the same pixel grid as the art
- Limited character sets — uppercase often only, or simplified lowercase fitting tight vertical space
- Fixed-width strongly preferred — monospace fonts are native to pixel art, proportional feels wrong
- System fonts from classic hardware — the actual fonts from NES, DOS, Amiga as direct references
- High contrast for readability — dark text on light, or light on dark, no subtle tonal differences
- Bitmap scaling only — fonts scale at integer multiples (2x, 3x) never fractional, keeping edges sharp

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT anti-aliased** — the entire point is visible, sharp pixel edges. Any smoothing destroys the aesthetic immediately.
- **NOT high resolution** — pixel art means seeing the pixels. If it looks smooth at normal viewing distance, the resolution is too high.
- **NOT gradient-based** — colors step, they don't blend. Dithering creates the illusion of gradients through pattern, not actual smooth transitions.
- **NOT too many colors** — strict palette limitation is fundamental. Unlimited colors is not pixel art, it's low-resolution illustration.
- **NOT photographic** — pixel art is stylized and iconic, not realistic. Forms are simplified to their essential shapes.
- **NOT voxel art** — voxels are 3D cubes; pixels are 2D squares. Related but distinct aesthetics.
- **NOT vector that looks pixelated** — authentic pixel art is built pixel-by-pixel, not vector shapes with a pixel filter.
- This must look like actual video game art — sprites you could imagine animating, tiles that could build levels, the authentic craft of placing individual pixels with purpose.

## Best For

Gaming and entertainment topics, technology and computing subjects, nostalgia and retro themes, tutorials and how-tos (inventory-style breakdowns), youth-oriented content, indie and creative technology, anything benefiting from playful, approachable visual style, data that can be iconified into sprite-like elements.
