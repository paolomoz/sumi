# ukiyo-e

Japanese woodblock print aesthetic (浮世絵) from the Edo period — bold outlines, flat color areas, layered compositions.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Indigo blue (ai-iro), vermillion red (shu), Prussian blue (bero-ai)
- Background: Warm cream (unprinted paper white), bokashi gradient skies
- Accents: Safflower pink (beni), yellow ochre (odo), verdigris green (rokusho), sumi black

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Classic | Indigo + vermillion + black + paper white |
| Nature | Verdigris green + ochre + indigo + pink |
| Dramatic | Prussian blue + vermillion + black + white |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Hokusai** | Dramatic nature, dynamic movement | Bold natural forces, dynamic waves, powerful composition |
| **Hiroshige** | Serene landscapes, atmospheric depth | Rain/mist effects, atmospheric perspective, peaceful scenes |
| **Bijin-ga** | Elegant figures, refined details | Sophisticated composition, refined patterns, human-centered |

## Visual Elements

- Bold, confident black outlines (sumi ink) with varying line weights
- Flat color areas with no gradients within shapes
- Colors appear layered, as if printed sequentially
- Subtle color bleeding at edges (bokashi effect for skies and water)
- Visible wood grain texture suggestion
- Paper texture undertone, matte non-glossy appearance
- Traditional cloud patterns (kumo) as section separators
- Stylized wave patterns, gold leaf accents
- No photorealistic rendering, no soft gradients within shapes, no 3D perspective

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Vertical stacking with clouds separating layers | Mountain landscapes |
| Flow/process | Diagonal movement, water/path motifs | River scenes, Tokaido road |
| Connections | Bridges, boats between islands | Harbor scenes |
| Cycles | Circular wave patterns, seasonal motifs | Great Wave, cherry blossoms |
| Comparison | Side-by-side panels (diptych style) | Bijin-ga portraits |
| Categories | Distinct floating islands or platforms | Floating world scenes |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Ukiyo-e Metaphor |
|------------------|------------------|
| Data/information | Scrolls, flowing water |
| Processes | Paths, rivers, bridges, journeys |
| Systems | Islands, buildings, districts |
| Connections | Bridges, boats, flying cranes |
| Growth | Cherry blossoms, bamboo, pine trees |
| Time | Seasons, moon phases, tides |
| Hierarchy | Mountain layers, castle levels |
| Protection | Castle walls, samurai, barriers |
| Speed | Running horses, swift water, wind |
| Stability | Mountains, ancient trees, stones |

## Typography

- Brush calligraphy style for titles
- Clean, readable labels with ink-brush character
- Text integrated into composition as banners, cartouches, or scroll elements
- Consistent with woodblock printing aesthetic

## Best For

Strategic concepts, architecture diagrams, process flows, hierarchy explanations, journey narratives, system overviews
