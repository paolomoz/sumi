# axonometric

Three-dimensional objects floating in clean white space, viewed from above at a precise 30-degree angle, with parallel lines that never converge — the technical illustration style of IKEA assembly manuals, architectural exploded-view drawings, and SimCity urban planning. Components pull apart along invisible axes to reveal inner workings, layers separate like geological strata, and every bolt, bracket, and beam reads with crystalline mechanical clarity because there is no perspective distortion to deceive the eye. This is Eames instruction booklets, Dieter Rams product schematics, and Apple teardown posters — engineering precision rendered as visual poetry.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Clean white (#FFFFFF) or light warm gray (#F5F5F5) background, charcoal black (#2D2D2D) for all linework, mid-gray (#888888) for secondary shading planes
- Object fills: Flat muted pastels — powder blue (#A8C5D9), soft salmon (#E8A89D), pale mint (#B5D9C4), light lavender (#C5B8D9), warm sand (#E5D9C3), fog gray (#D5D5D5)
- Technical accents: Signal orange (#FF9800) or highlight yellow (#FFF176) for callout circles and key components; teal (#00897B) for process-flow arrows
- Shadows: Cool flat gray (#D0D0D0) cast as parallelogram planes beneath objects, offset at the axonometric angle — never soft or blurred
- Construction lines: Thin dashed mid-gray (#AAAAAA) for alignment guides, assembly paths, and invisible edges
- Text: Charcoal (#2D2D2D) on light backgrounds; white reversed out of colored component fills; thin leader lines always the same gray as construction lines

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Technical Manual | White background + black linework + single accent (signal orange) highlighting key parts — IKEA instruction clarity, one color pops against monochrome |
| Pastel Components | White background + powder blue, salmon, mint, lavender fills on discrete objects + charcoal outlines — friendly, approachable, startup-product-page aesthetic |
| Monochrome Blueprint | Pure black and white with three-tone gray shading — no color, maximum technical authority, patent-drawing energy |
| Dark Blueprint | Dark navy (#1A2F4A) background + white/light blue linework + yellow callout accents — inverted technical drawing, screen-friendly |
| Material Coded | Different colors for different materials: wood (warm tan #D4B896), metal (cool gray #A0A0A0), plastic (powder blue #A8C5D9), glass (pale blue #C8E0F0 with 50% transparency) |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Exploded** | Components pulled apart along assembly axes revealing internal structure | Each part floats in sequence above/below its assembled position, separated by thin dashed alignment lines showing how pieces snap together — the IKEA manual view. Widest part gaps = most spatial clarity |
| **Cutaway** | Object with one corner or quadrant surgically removed to expose interior | A clean 45-degree section cut slicing through the 3D form, revealing chambers, layers, and internal mechanisms while maintaining overall silhouette — more integrated than exploded |
| **Stacked Layers** | Horizontal planes floating above each other showing hierarchy or sequence | Each layer is a complete horizontal plane separated vertically with consistent spacing, reading bottom-to-top like a layer cake — infrastructure below, UI above. Thin vertical alignment columns at corners |
| **Cityscape** | Multiple buildings/objects arranged in axonometric urban grid | Bird's-eye city blocks, streets, and buildings all in parallel projection — every building same scale regardless of distance, no convergence, perfect for showing spatial relationships and zoning |
| **Wireframe** | Transparent linework showing all edges including hidden ones | No solid fills, just structural edges — hidden lines rendered as dashes, visible lines solid — revealing total geometry like an X-ray. Pure skeletal truth of the object |

## Visual Elements

- **30/60-degree isometric projection** — vertical lines stay perfectly vertical, horizontal lines slope at exactly 30 degrees left and right. The rigid geometric grid is non-negotiable and creates the entire visual language
- **Parallel edges that never converge** — unlike perspective, every parallel set of lines in the real object remains parallel in the drawing. No vanishing points, no foreshortening, no distance distortion. A 1-meter cube at the back is the same drawn size as one at the front
- **Exploded separation with dashed alignment lines** — components pulled apart along their assembly axes with thin gray dashed lines showing the invisible path each part takes to reach its assembled position. The gaps between parts are consistent and generous
- **Flat single-color fills per face, zero gradients** — each face of a 3D object gets one flat color: top face lightest, left face medium, right face darkest. This three-tone shading creates readable 3D from pure flat color
- **Consistent line weight throughout** — all outlines the same stroke width (or at most two weights: heavier for outer silhouette, lighter for inner surface edges). No expressive thick-thin variation
- **Flat parallelogram shadows** — drop shadows cast as flat gray parallelograms offset down and to one side, maintaining the isometric angle. Never blurred, never graduated, never ambient-occluded
- **Numbered callout circles with leader lines** — small orange or black circled numbers connected by thin straight lines to specific parts, keyed to a numbered legend. The callout style of every technical manual since 1950
- **Dotted isometric floor grid** — a faint gray dot grid on the ground plane establishing the 30-degree coordinate system and grounding floating objects in shared space
- **Transparent/ghosted faces** — partially transparent planes revealing internal components through them. Hidden edges rendered as dashes. The X-ray superpower of axonometric
- **Assembly sequence arrows** — curved arrows showing rotation direction, straight arrows showing insertion vectors, all rendered in accent color. Movement instructions without words
- **Scale reference figures** — tiny simplified human silhouettes standing next to objects for immediate intuitive size comprehension
- **NO organic flowing curves, NO decorative flourishes, NO expressive linework** — this is engineering illustration. Every line serves a structural purpose. If a line does not describe geometry, it does not belong
- **NO perspective convergence of any kind** — if lines converge toward a vanishing point, the entire style collapses. Axonometric IS the parallel projection

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Stacked horizontal planes floating above each other with consistent vertical gaps, most important layer largest or most detailed, thin alignment columns at corners | Layer cake architecture diagram — infrastructure at bottom, services middle, UI top |
| Assembly/process | Exploded sequence reading left-to-right or bottom-to-top, each step adding components with numbered callouts | IKEA assembly manual — component sequence building toward finished product |
| Connections | Objects arranged on isometric grid with connecting pipes, wires, or lines running between them at 30-degree angles | Server rack network diagram — boxes linked by visible data paths |
| Cycles | Four objects arranged at corners of an isometric diamond, connected by directional arrows flowing clockwise around the perimeter | Recycling process or feedback loop rendered as a rotating square in 3D space |
| Comparison | Two parallel exploded views side by side at identical scale — same structure, different highlighted components or configurations | Product comparison: Option A vs. Option B, differences in signal orange |
| Categories | Color-coded clusters of axonometric objects grouped in spatial zones on a shared grid plane | Tool organization: cutting tools (red zone), measuring tools (blue zone) |
| Parts of a whole | Single large cutaway object with every internal component labeled via numbered callouts and leader lines | Anatomy diagram — object as body, callouts identifying organs |
| System flow | Axonometric building or machine with bold directional arrows showing input entering, processing stages, output exiting | Factory diagram with raw materials at one end, finished goods at other |
| Growth/scale | Same object shown at three progressively larger scales, left to right, all in identical axonometric projection for true comparison | T-shirt sizes: S, M, L rendered at truthful scale |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Axonometric Metaphor |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Data/information | Labeled boxes or containers of proportional volume arranged on the isometric grid — bigger box = more data |
| Processes | Exploded assembly sequence — components flying together step by step along dashed guide lines |
| Systems | Connected objects on a grid with visible pipes, wires, and conduits showing physical relationships |
| Connections | Lines and tubes running between objects at 30-degree angles — tangible, measurable physical links |
| Hierarchy | Stacked layers — most critical at bottom (foundation) or top (user-facing), size expressing importance |
| Growth | Progressive assembly states left-to-right, or objects increasing in size across the composition |
| Time | Left-to-right or bottom-to-top sequence of assembly states, each stage more complete |
| Containment | Objects nested inside transparent or cutaway containers, visible through ghosted walls |
| Flow | Bold colored arrows showing direction of movement through the axonometric space |
| Complexity | Fully exploded view with many widely separated components — more parts = more complex |
| Simplicity | Clean assembled object with smooth exterior — complexity hidden inside, surface calm |
| Users/people | Small isometric human figures standing next to objects for scale and context |
| Integration | Components shown converging, dashed alignment lines merging toward assembled state |
| Transparency | Wireframe or glass objects showing every internal edge — nothing hidden, nothing obscured |

## Typography

- Clean technical sans-serif: DIN, Helvetica Neue, Roboto, Source Sans Pro — zero personality, maximum legibility, the typeface of engineering
- Small consistently sized labels with straight leader lines connecting to components — never curved, never swoopy
- Numbers in small circles for part callouts, keyed to separate numbered legend
- Titles placed outside the main axonometric view area, never overlapping the 3D objects
- Horizontal text only — never rotated to match isometric angles. Text stays in screen-plane
- ALL CAPS for component labels giving an engineering-drawing feel; sentence case for descriptions
- Color-coded labels matching component fill colors for instant identification
- NO decorative fonts, NO serif faces, NO hand-drawn lettering — this is technical drafting, not art

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT perspective drawing** — the entire point of axonometric is that parallel lines stay parallel. No vanishing points, no horizon line, no convergence. If lines converge, the whole style is broken. This is the single most critical rule.
- **NOT realistic 3D rendering** — no ray-traced lighting, no photorealistic materials, no ambient occlusion, no subsurface scattering. Flat color fills, consistent line weights, the honesty of technical illustration, not product photography.
- **NOT isometric-technical** (the adjacent style) — isometric-technical often adds decorative color gradients, soft shadows, and stylized human figures with personality. Axonometric is stripped-down, clinical, and engineering-first. If it looks friendly and approachable, pull back toward technical austerity.
- **NOT randomly floating objects** — exploded views have logical separation along assembly axes with alignment guides. Objects do not scatter like confetti — they pull apart in a way that shows exactly how they fit together.
- **NOT flat 2D icon art** — objects must read as three-dimensional. Top, left-side, and right-side faces must be visible and distinctly shaded. If it looks like a flat material-design icon, it is not axonometric.
- **NOT bauhaus or constructivist** — those styles use geometric shapes as expressive art. Axonometric uses geometry as literal structural description. A circle in Bauhaus is a cosmic form; a circle in axonometric is a bearing or a pipe cross-section.
- **NOT organic or decorative** — no flowing curves, no botanical forms, no ornamental motifs. Axonometric excels at manufactured, geometric, hard-edged objects. Trees and clouds do not belong in this vocabulary.
- This must look like a page ripped from a Braun product service manual or an Apple hardware teardown poster — precise, clinical, beautifully clear, and completely without artistic ego.

## Best For

Product explanations, assembly sequences, technical documentation, architectural overviews, system and network diagrams, organizational layer structures, how-things-work explainers, software architecture visualization, comparison of configurations, hardware teardowns, onboarding flows showing component relationships, anything that benefits from seeing all parts clearly without perspective distortion.
