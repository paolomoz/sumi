# axonometric

Three-dimensional objects floating in clean white space, viewed from above at a precise 30-degree angle, with parallel lines that never converge — the technical illustration style of assembly manuals, architectural diagrams, and exploded-view drawings. Objects pull apart to reveal inner components, layers separate to show construction sequence, and everything reads with crystalline clarity because there's no perspective distortion to deceive the eye.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Clean white (#FFFFFF) or light gray (#F5F5F5) background, charcoal black (#333333) for linework, mid-gray (#888888) for shading
- Object fills: Flat, muted colors — powder blue (#A8C5D9), soft salmon (#E8A89D), pale mint (#B5D9C4), light lavender (#C5B8D9), warm sand (#E5D9C3)
- Technical accents: Highlight yellow (#FFF176) or signal orange (#FF9800) for callouts and key components
- Shadows: Cool gray (#D0D0D0) as flat shadow planes beneath objects, or soft drop shadows offset at the axonometric angle
- Text: Charcoal on light backgrounds, white on colored components, thin leader lines connecting labels

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Technical Manual | White background + black linework + single accent color (blue or orange) highlighting key parts — IKEA instruction clarity |
| Pastel Components | White background + powder blue, salmon, mint components as discrete objects + charcoal outlines — friendly and approachable |
| Monochrome | Pure black and white with gray shading planes — no color, maximum technical precision |
| Isometric Blueprint | Dark blue (#1E3A5F) background + white/light blue linework + yellow accents — inverted technical drawing |
| Material Coded | Different colors for different materials: wood (warm tan), metal (cool gray), plastic (bright primaries), glass (pale blue with transparency) |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Exploded** | Components pulled apart along assembly axis revealing internal structure | Objects separated with dashed alignment lines showing how parts fit together, floating in sequence above/below their assembled position — the assembly manual view |
| **Cutaway** | Object with one corner or quadrant removed to show interior | Three-dimensional section cut at 45 degrees, revealing internal structure while maintaining overall form — more integrated than exploded view |
| **Stacked** | Layered planes floating above each other showing hierarchy or sequence | Horizontal layers separated vertically, each layer a complete plane, stack reading bottom-to-top or top-to-bottom — the layer cake diagram |
| **Cityscape** | Multiple buildings/objects arranged in axonometric urban grid | Bird's-eye city view with blocks, streets, and buildings all in parallel projection — no perspective vanishing, every building the same scale regardless of distance |
| **Wireframe** | Transparent linework showing all edges including hidden ones | No solid fills, just line edges — hidden lines can be dashed — revealing total structure like an X-ray view |

## Visual Elements

- **30/60 degree projection**: Vertical lines stay vertical, horizontal lines go up-right at 30° and up-left at 30° — the classic isometric grid (technically "isometric" is a subset of axonometric, but commonly conflated)
- **Parallel edges that never converge**: Unlike perspective, parallel lines in the object remain parallel in the drawing — no vanishing points, no distance distortion
- **Exploded separation with alignment lines**: Components pulled apart along their assembly axis, with thin dashed lines showing how they align when assembled
- **Flat color fills with no gradients**: Each face of an object is a single flat color, creating the faceted look of early 3D graphics
- **Three-tone shading**: Top faces lightest, one side medium, other side darkest — simulating consistent light from above-left
- **Consistent line weight**: All outlines the same weight (or two weights max: heavier for outer edges, lighter for inner details)
- **Drop shadows at axonometric angle**: Shadows cast as flat parallelograms offset down and to one side, maintaining the projection angle
- **Numbered callouts with leader lines**: Small circled numbers connected by thin lines to specific parts, keyed to a legend
- **Grid planes and alignment guides**: Dotted or light gray grids showing the isometric floor plane, helping ground floating objects
- **Transparent/ghosted elements**: Partially transparent faces revealing internal components — edges visible through surfaces
- **Assembly sequence arrows**: Curved arrows showing rotation or straight arrows showing insertion direction
- **Scale figures and objects**: Tiny human silhouettes or common objects (coins, pens) for size reference
- **Consistent object height across distance**: Unlike perspective, a 1-meter cube in the foreground is the same size as one in the background

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Stacked horizontal planes floating above each other, most important level largest or most detailed | Organizational layer cake — infrastructure at bottom, application layer, user layer at top |
| Assembly/process | Exploded sequence reading left-to-right or bottom-to-top, each step adding components | IKEA assembly manual — component sequence building toward finished product |
| Connections | Objects arranged on isometric grid with connecting lines/pipes/wires running between them | Network diagram with servers, databases, and connection paths all in axonometric |
| Comparison | Two parallel exploded views side by side — same structure, different components highlighted | Product comparison showing option A and option B at same scale |
| Categories | Grouped clusters of axonometric objects in different zones, color-coded by category | Tool organization: cutting tools (red zone), measuring tools (blue zone), fastening tools (yellow zone) |
| Parts of a whole | Single large object with cutaway revealing internal components labeled | Anatomy diagram — object as body, callouts identifying each internal organ/component |
| Spatial relationships | City block or room layout in axonometric, showing how spaces connect | Floor plan extruded into 3D, furniture and people placed to show usage |
| System flow | Axonometric machine or building with arrows showing input → process → output flow | Factory diagram with raw materials entering, processing stages, finished goods exiting |
| Growth/scale | Same object shown at progressively larger scales, or growing sequence of similar objects | Small → medium → large product sizes, all in consistent axonometric view |
| Anatomy/structure | Fully exploded object with every component labeled and numbered | Technical service manual showing every replaceable part |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Axonometric Metaphor |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Data/information | Labeled boxes or containers of proportional sizes arranged on isometric grid |
| Processes | Exploded assembly sequence — components coming together step by step |
| Systems | Connected objects on a grid with visible pipes/wires/paths showing relationships |
| Connections | Lines and tubes running between objects at isometric angles — physical links |
| Hierarchy | Stacked layers with most important at top, or largest object with smaller ones orbiting |
| Growth | Progressive assembly sequence, or objects increasing in size across the composition |
| Time | Left-to-right or bottom-to-top sequence of assembly states |
| Containment | Objects nested inside transparent containers, or cutaway revealing contents |
| Flow | Arrows showing direction of movement through the axonometric space |
| Complexity | Fully exploded view with many separated components — more parts = more complex |
| Simplicity | Assembled, integrated object with clean exterior — complexity hidden inside |
| Users/people | Small isometric human figures interacting with objects for scale and context |
| Components/parts | Individual labeled pieces in an exploded view, each distinct and numbered |
| Integration | Components shown moving together, dashed alignment lines converging toward assembled state |
| Transparency | Glass or wireframe objects showing internal structure — nothing hidden |

## Typography

- Clean technical sans-serif: DIN, Helvetica, Roboto, Source Sans — no personality, maximum legibility
- Small, consistently sized labels with leader lines connecting to components
- Numbers in circles for part callouts, keyed to separate legend when needed
- Titles outside the main diagram area, not overlapping the axonometric view
- Horizontal text only — never rotated to match isometric angles (unlike some architectural conventions)
- Optional technical style: ALL CAPS for labels, giving an engineering drawing feel
- Color-coded labels matching component colors for easy identification
- NO decorative fonts, NO serif faces, NO hand-drawn lettering — this is technical illustration

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT perspective drawing**: The entire point is that parallel lines stay parallel. No vanishing points, no horizon line, no convergence. If lines converge, it's not axonometric.
- **NOT realistic 3D rendering**: Flat color fills, consistent line weights, no ray-traced lighting or photorealistic materials. This is technical illustration, not product photography.
- **NOT randomly floating objects**: Exploded views have *logical separation along assembly axes* with alignment guides. Objects don't just scatter randomly — they pull apart in a way that shows how they fit together.
- **NOT flat 2D**: While simplified, objects must read as three-dimensional. Top, front, and side faces must be visible. If it looks like a flat icon, it's not axonometric.
- **NO organic flowing forms**: Axonometric excels at geometric manufactured objects. Don't use it for natural subjects (trees, animals, clouds) that have no clear faces or edges.
- **NO cluttered overlapping**: The clarity of axonometric comes from objects being *spatially separated*. Overlapping objects lose the see-through-everything clarity.
- **NOT decorative or artistic**: This is functional technical illustration. No decorative flourishes, no expressive linework, no stylistic distortion. Clarity over beauty.
