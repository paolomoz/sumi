# claymation

The tactile magic of stop-motion clay animation — Aardman's Wallace and Gromit, Laika's Coraline, the handmade charm of figures molded from plasticine and photographed frame by frame. Every surface shows fingerprints, every character has that slight imperfection that proves a human hand shaped them. Rounded forms with visible tool marks, wire armature poses, the particular way clay catches light differently than any digital render. This is the uncanny valley in reverse: the deliberate handmade quality that makes the artificial feel more alive than photorealism ever could.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Muted plasticine colors — soft orange (#E67E22), clay green (#2ECC71), dusty blue (#5DADE2), warm red (#E74C3C)
- Neutrals: Natural clay tan (#D2B48C), gray (#95A5A6), brown (#8B4513), cream (#FAEBD7)
- Skin tones: Pale plasticine flesh (#FDBF6F), rosy cheeks (#E8A0BF), varied clay skin tones
- Backgrounds: Painted theatrical backdrops, miniature sets, slightly desaturated stage lighting
- Accents: Bright primary accents for eyes, props, details — saturated but still matte
- Shadows: Soft, natural shadows from actual lighting, not painted on

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Aardman Warm | Tan/cream + soft greens + warm reds — cozy British stop-motion |
| Laika Dark | Desaturated palette + deep shadows + accent pops — cinematic stop-motion |
| Bright Playful | Saturated plasticine primaries — children's clay animation |
| Natural Organic | Earth tones, natural clay colors, wood and fabric textures |
| Vintage | Sepia-tinted, muted palette — nostalgic classic stop-motion |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Character** | Clay figures as the focus, expressive faces, distinctive personalities | Rounded forms, visible fingerprints, armature-friendly poses, characterful imperfection |
| **Scene** | Full miniature sets with multiple figures | Theatrical staging, practical lighting, handmade props and environments |
| **Abstract** | Clay shapes and forms without character, sculptural | Morphing organic forms, material exploration, abstract stop-motion art |
| **Cutout** | Flat clay elements in layers, simpler construction | Simplified forms, layer-based depth, papercraft-adjacent |
| **Mixed Media** | Clay combined with fabric, wire, found objects | Texture variety, mixed materials, expanded craft vocabulary |

## Visual Elements

- **Fingerprint textures** — visible impressions in clay surfaces, proof of hand-making
- **Rounded, bulbous forms** — everything slightly soft and organic, no sharp edges possible in clay
- **Armature poses** — characters positioned at angles that work for wire armature puppets
- **Googly or bead eyes** — inserted spheres or beads for eyes, the classic stop-motion look
- **Visible tool marks** — indentations from sculpting tools, seams from clay blending
- **Theatrical lighting** — dramatic shadows from miniature stage lighting, soft but directional
- **Miniature sets** — backgrounds that read as tiny constructed environments
- **Squash and stretch** — subtle distortion suggesting animation frames between poses
- **Fabric and wire details** — clothing, accessories made from real materials at small scale
- **Matte surfaces** — clay doesn't shine, all surfaces have soft matte finish
- **Blend lines** — visible seams where different clay colors meet
- **Scale cues** — elements that reveal the miniature nature (oversized textures, etc.)

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Larger characters foreground, smaller background, theatrical depth | Stage-like layered composition |
| Flow/process | Characters moving through a set left to right, or sequential scene panels | Story sequence, animation storyboard |
| Connections | Characters interacting physically, hands touching, grouped formations | Social scene, conversation, collaboration |
| Cycles | Circular arrangement or implied rotation, loop-ready poses | Animation cycle, seasonal change, process loop |
| Comparison | Side-by-side characters or objects, scale comparison | Character lineup, before/after transformation |
| Categories | Grid of clay objects or characters, collection display | Character roster, prop inventory, type specimens |
| Emotion | Character expressions, exaggerated clay faces | Comedy and pathos through puppet performance |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Claymation Metaphor |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Data/information | Size and detail of clay figures/objects |
| Processes | Sequential poses suggesting animation, transformation morphs |
| Systems | Mechanical contraptions, Rube Goldberg machines in miniature |
| Connections | Physical touching, shared spaces, handshakes between figures |
| Growth | Scaling up, clay figures morphing larger |
| Time | Animation frames, implied motion, pose sequences |
| Hierarchy | Size and foreground/background position in the set |
| Protection | Shelters, containers, figures protecting smaller figures |
| Speed | Stretched poses, blur implied, action poses |
| Stability | Grounded poses, solid bases, secure staging |
| Users/people | Clay character figures with personality and expression |
| Ideas | Light bulb props, thought bubbles in clay, "eureka" poses |
| Energy | Dynamic poses, implied movement, expressive animation |
| Transformation | Morphing shapes, before/after poses, material change |

## Typography

- **Hand-formed clay letters** — letterforms sculpted from clay, with finger marks and irregularity
- **Theatrical signage** — letters as miniature props in the set, painted wooden signs
- **Embedded in scene** — text as part of the physical diorama, not floating overlays
- **Rounded forms** — no sharp serifs, all letterforms softened by the clay medium
- **Bead or wire letters** — alternative materials for set decoration text
- **Handwritten labels** — sketched text suggesting production notes, storyboard aesthetic
- **Vintage lettering** — serif faces suggesting classic animation title cards

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT smooth or perfect** — the charm is in the handmade imperfection. No digital perfection.
- **NOT shiny** — clay is matte. No glossy surfaces, no specular highlights.
- **NOT thin or detailed** — clay has physical limits. Features are simplified, rounded, achievable in plasticine.
- **NOT digitally rendered** — even "clay-look" CGI reads differently. This is actual stop-motion aesthetic.
- **NOT 2D illustration** — forms have volume, light wraps around them, they exist in 3D space.
- **NOT anime or cartoon** — this is specifically the stop-motion puppet aesthetic, not drawn animation.
- **NOT photorealistic** — stylization and charm, not uncanny perfection.
- This must look like actual Aardman or Laika production art — tactile, dimensional, handmade, lit on a miniature stage, with all the beautiful imperfection of real clay touched by real hands.

## Best For

Storytelling and narrative content, humorous and whimsical topics, character-driven explanations, educational content for younger audiences, creative and artistic subjects, topics benefiting from warmth and approachability, transformation and process visualization, anything where handmade charm adds value.
