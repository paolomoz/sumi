## Visual Elements

- Clean geometric grid structure — no organic shapes, no curves
- Light gray (#F5F5F5) rectangular content panels as visual containers
- Bold full-bleed section dividers in Adobe Red or black
- Two-panel 50/50 splits (text left, visual right) as core composition
- Multi-column content grids (2–5 columns) with consistent gutters
- Rounded-corner cards for product screenshots and feature callouts
- Flat vector illustrations and icons — no gradients on shapes, solid fills only
- Photography with gradient overlays (transparent → 80% black) when used as backgrounds
- Subtle blurred background images behind text for depth
- Thin horizontal rules to separate content sections
- No decorative borders or ornamental elements — structure comes from whitespace and color blocks
- High information density — multiple content zones per composition

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Stacked horizontal bands — red header, white content, gray footer | Adobe section slide pattern |
| Flow/process | Left-to-right numbered columns on white, connected by thin gray lines | Multi-column product feature layout |
| Comparison | Side-by-side panels — one light gray, one white — with contrasting accent colors | Two-panel pitch layout |
| Categories | Grid of gray content cards with colored top-edge accents | Feature grid pattern |
| Metrics/KPIs | Large bold numbers in Adobe Red or black, small gray label beneath | Executive dashboard slide |
| Before/after | Black left panel (before) → white right panel (after), red divider line | Transformation narrative |
| Feature list | Vertical stack of icon + text rows on white, thin gray separators | Product capability slide |
| Overview/summary | Central bold statement on white, supporting details in surrounding gray panels | Hero statement layout |

| Systems | Nested gray panels, container-within-container structure |
| Connections | Thin gray connecting lines between content blocks |
| Growth | Ascending bar segments in accent colors, upward arrows |
| Time | Horizontal timeline with red milestone markers |

| Ideas | Lightbulb icons or bright accent color highlight against neutral background |

## Typography

- Clean sans-serif throughout — no serifs, no decorative fonts
- Bold/black weight for headlines, creating strong visual hierarchy through weight contrast alone
- Regular weight body text, generous line height (110%)
- Tight letter-spacing on large headings for density and impact
- Light/semilight weight for supporting text and captions
- Text aligned left for content, centered only for hero statements and section dividers
- Large type sizes for display titles (44–54pt equivalent), stepping down sharply to body (14–16pt)
- White text reversed out on dark/red backgrounds
- No text effects — no shadows, no outlines, no gradients on type
