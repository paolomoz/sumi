# rinpa

Gold leaf meets bold nature — the decorative brilliance of Japan's Rinpa school (17th-19th century). Irises bursting in electric ultramarine against hammered gold, stylized waves crashing in repeated curves, cherry blossoms scattered across shimmering metallic grounds. This is nature abstracted into pure decorative power, where flat bold shapes float on luminous gold leaf backgrounds.

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Classic Gold | Ultramarine blue + vermillion red + hammered gold ground + ink black accents |
| Silver Autumn | Malachite green + plum purple + silver leaf + saffron highlights |
| Red & Gold | Deep vermillion + gold leaf + white gofun + black outline |
| Iris | Electric ultramarine + malachite green + gold ground + touches of white |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Korin** | Bold flat shapes, gold grounds | Irises, plum branches, waves — graphic silhouettes floating on gold, extreme simplification, decorative power |
| **Sotatsu** | Tarashikomi ink pooling, atmospheric | Wet ink bleeding into wet ink creating organic pooled edges, nature subjects with controlled accidents |
| **Hoitsu** | Refined elegance, seasonal poetry | Delicate cherry blossoms, autumn grasses, more naturalistic but still flat, silver and gold grounds |
| **Kenzan** | Ceramic-inspired, pattern integration | Geometric patterns mixed with nature motifs, pottery decoration sensibility |

## Visual Elements

- Hammered gold leaf backgrounds with visible texture — not smooth gold, but beaten metal with subtle dimples and variation
- Bold flat color shapes with no internal shading — an iris petal is one flat ultramarine blue, not a gradient
- Dramatic asymmetrical compositions with subjects cut off at frame edges
- Stylized waves in repeating curved patterns — water rendered as rhythmic decorative lines, not realistic
- Tarashikomi technique: wet ink dropped into wet areas creating pooled, bleeding edges with dark outlines around lighter centers
- Cherry blossoms scattered across gold — pink petals floating on luminous metallic ground
- Irises as bold upright forms with sword-like leaves in electric blue and green
- Plum branches rendered as bold black silhouettes with white or pink blossoms
- Cloud bands as decorative gold horizontal strips separating compositional areas
- Red sun disc or moon against gold sky
- Silver leaf used for water, moon, winter elements
- Thick black ink outlines defining shapes against gold
- White gofun (crusite shell powder) used for highlights, cranes, snow
- Nature subjects grouped and repeated as decorative patterns
- Extreme cropping — only part of a chrysanthemum visible, implying the rest continues beyond frame

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Stacked horizontal cloud bands on gold, each band containing different content | Korin's screens with gold cloud separators |
| Flow/process | Flowing water pattern connecting elements from right to left | Waves carrying elements across the composition |
| Connections | Plum branches arching across gold ground linking separate subject groups | Korin's Red and White Plum Blossoms |
| Cycles | Seasonal subjects (cherry, iris, chrysanthemum, plum) arranged on shared gold ground | Seasonal folding screens |
| Comparison | Paired subjects on left and right panels (byobu format) | Sotatsu's paired screens |
| Categories | Distinct nature subjects repeated in rhythmic patterns across gold | Irises repeated in decorative bands |
| Growth | Vertical iris stems or bamboo rising from water | Irises growing from gold water pattern |
| Networks | Intertwining plum branches with blossoms at each node | Branch structure as connection diagram |
| Radial | Chrysanthemum as center with petals radiating outward | Kenzan ceramic patterns |
| Layered | Elements floating at different implied depths on flat gold | Cranes flying across gold with clouds behind |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Rinpa Metaphor |
|------------------|----------------|
| Data/information | Scattered cherry blossom petals — more petals = more data, denser clusters = concentrations |
| Processes | Flowing wave patterns — the curving repeated lines carry the eye along a path |
| Systems | A gold folding screen with multiple panels — each panel a component, gold unifying the whole |
| Connections | Plum branches reaching across gold space, connecting blossom nodes |
| Growth | Iris stems shooting upward from water, from bulb to full bloom |
| Time | Seasons progressing across panels — plum to cherry to iris to chrysanthemum |
| Hierarchy | Cloud bands stacking — higher cloud bands contain more important elements |
| Protection | Gold ground itself — the precious surface elevating and protecting what floats upon it |
| Speed | Wave crests breaking in repeated patterns, birds in flight across gold |
| Stability | Mountain forms on gold ground, ancient pine tree silhouettes |
| Users/people | Stylized figures in Heian court dress, simplified to flat decorative shapes |
| Ideas | Red sun disc on gold — a single bold shape commanding attention |
| Energy | Crashing waves, wind-blown grasses, dynamic diagonal compositions |
| Categories | Different flower species, each in their signature flat color treatment |
| Transformation | Chrysalis to butterfly, bud to bloom, seasonal change |

## Typography

- Bold brush calligraphy integrated into gold ground — text as decorative element
- Titles rendered in thick black sumi ink, brush-written, placed within or beside compositions
- Labels float on gold like scattered petals — elegant brush script
- Seal stamps (hanko) in vermillion red as signature and compositional punctuation
- Text can be placed in vertical cartouches of contrasting color (indigo on gold, gold on indigo)
- No modern fonts — all text appears hand-brushed in traditional Japanese style
- White gofun text on dark color bands for contrast

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT ukiyo-e** — Rinpa is decorative and flat, not narrative woodblock print scenes. NO perspective, NO architectural backgrounds, NO Edo street scenes
- **NOT sumi-e** — Rinpa uses BOLD FLAT COLORS on GOLD, not monochrome ink washes. NO misty atmospherics, NO brush stroke texture emphasis
- **NOT realistic botanical illustration** — nature subjects are STYLIZED and SIMPLIFIED into decorative flat shapes, not scientifically accurate
- **NOT digital gold gradient** — the gold must read as METAL LEAF with texture and variation, not a smooth gold-colored gradient
- **NOT sparse minimalist** — Rinpa is DECORATIVE and often DENSE with repeated patterns. Empty space is gold, not white paper
- **NOT Western illuminated manuscript** — despite gold, this is Japanese decorative, not medieval European
- **NO 3D rendering or realistic lighting** — everything is flat decorative shapes on flat metal ground
- **NO photographic nature imagery** — all nature is stylized into bold graphic forms

## Reference Images
