- NO delicate serifs. NO script fonts. NO lowercase body text.

## Anti-Patterns

**NOT modern comic art**: No painted rendering, no photorealistic shading, no digital gradients. Keep it flat with VISIBLE halftone dots.

**NOT gritty or dark**: Golden Age is optimistic. Heroes are heroic. Colors are bright. No moral ambiguity, no excessive violence, no grim tone.

**NOT manga style**: No big eyes, no sweat drops, no chibi proportions. Western anatomy with exaggerated musculature.

**NOT subtle**: Everything is BOLD. Bold colors, bold lines, bold poses. If it whispers, it's wrong. This style SHOUTS.

**NOT realistic proportions**: Heroes have impossible anatomy—shoulders twice hip width, fists like bowling balls, 8-head-tall figures.

**NOT static poses**: Every figure should feel mid-action. Diagonals everywhere. Weight shifting. Fabric moving.

**NOT silver/bronze/modern age**: No anti-heroes, no dark storylines, no grim aesthetics. This is GOLDEN age: bright, punchy, optimistic.

**NOT without halftone**: The visible dot pattern is ESSENTIAL. Without Ben-Day dots, it looks like modern flat design, not vintage comics.
