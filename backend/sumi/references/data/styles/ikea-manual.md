# ikea-manual

Wordless instruction diagrams rendered with clinical Scandinavian simplicity — faceless line-drawn figures assembling, lifting, clicking components into place, each step numbered in a clean circle, arrows curving to show motion direction, dotted lines indicating where Part A slides into Slot B. This is the IKEA BILLY bookcase assembly guide, the LACK table instruction sheet, the universal language of Allen wrenches and cam locks — where complex assembly is distilled into silent, sequential pictograms understood by anyone on Earth regardless of language. Minimal line weight, maximum clarity, deliberate emptiness.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Black (#000000) for all linework — thin, precise, consistent weight throughout
- Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF) — clean, uncluttered paper stock
- Accent Red: IKEA signal red (#CC0000) for warnings, X-marks on wrong actions, and critical callouts
- Accent Green: Confirmation green (#4CAF50) for checkmarks and correct-action indicators (used sparingly)
- Grays: Light gray (#D0D0D0) for shadow/depth hints on assembled objects, medium gray (#999999) for secondary parts or pre-assembled components
- Skin tone: Warm beige (#E8D4B8) for the single flat skin tone on faceless human figures
- Highlight Yellow: Pale yellow (#FFF9C4) wash behind the current step's focus area (optional, used sparingly)

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Classic Manual | Black lines + white background + red warning accents — the iconic IKEA instruction sheet, nearly monochrome |
| Assembly Sequence | Black lines + light gray for already-assembled parts + black for current-step parts — temporal layering through value |
| Warning Panel | White background + red X + red circle-slash over incorrect action — universal prohibition sign language |
| Hardware Callout | Black lines + pale yellow highlight behind the specific screw/dowel/cam lock being used in this step |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Assembly** | Step-by-step construction sequence with numbered circles | Sequential panels showing components joining together, arrows indicating direction of motion, each step isolated and numbered, final assembled product shown in last panel |
| **Hardware** | Close-up callouts of specific fasteners and tools | Zoomed detail circles showing the exact screw, dowel, cam lock, or Allen wrench needed, with 1:1 scale indicators and quantity labels (x4, x8) |
| **Warning** | Do/Don't comparison panels showing correct vs. incorrect actions | Split panels: left side shows correct action with implied checkmark, right side shows incorrect action with red X overlay, same scenario both sides |
| **Inventory** | Parts laid out in organized grid before assembly begins | Every component drawn at same scale, labeled with letter codes (A, B, C), quantities noted, hardware in separate grouped section — the "before you begin" spread |

## Visual Elements

- **Thin consistent linework** — every line the same weight (approximately 1px), clean and precise, no variation in stroke. Not sketchy, not bold — uniform technical drafting quality
- **Faceless human figures** — simplified person outlines with round heads (no features), slightly bent posture showing effort, hands clearly gripping objects. Neutral warm beige skin fill, no clothing detail
- **Numbered step circles** — each assembly step marked with a circled number (1, 2, 3...) in the upper corner of its panel, clean sans-serif numeral
- **Curved motion arrows** — smooth arcs showing the direction a part should move: rotation, insertion, flipping. Arrow heads are simple, open triangles
- **Dotted alignment lines** — dashed lines showing where a part needs to go before it arrives, the ghost position of the component-to-be-placed
- **Exploded spacing** — components drawn slightly separated from their destination, floating in the exact trajectory they need to travel
- **1:1 hardware close-ups** — small circular insets showing the exact screw, dowel, or fitting at actual printed size, with quantity notation (x4)
- **Red X prohibition marks** — bold red X or circle-with-slash over actions that should NOT be done
- **Perspective-free flat projection** — objects drawn in simple three-quarter or flat orthographic view, never in dramatic perspective
- **Click/snap indicators** — small starburst or radiating lines at a joint point showing where two parts lock together
- **Scale reference hands** — human hands shown gripping, turning, or pressing to indicate which actions require manual force
- **Panel borders** — thin hairline rectangles separating each step, or no border at all with generous white space between steps
- **NO color fills on furniture** — objects are white with black outlines only, color reserved exclusively for warnings and callouts
- **NO decorative elements whatsoever** — no patterns, no textures, no backgrounds, no shadows beyond the lightest gray hint

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Sequential process | Numbered panels in reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom), each showing one discrete action, arrows connecting steps | IKEA BILLY bookcase pages 4-8 — one action per frame, clear sequence |
| Hierarchy/importance | Larger panel for the main action, smaller inset circles for hardware detail and tool requirements | Main assembly view with zoomed callout bubbles |
| Parts inventory | Grid layout of all components drawn at uniform scale, each labeled with letter code and quantity | The "open box and verify contents" first page of every IKEA manual |
| Warning/caution | Split panel: correct method on left, incorrect method on right with red X, identical framing for clear comparison | "Two person job" warning, or "do not overtighten" panel |
| Final result | Single larger panel showing the completed assembled product, clean and proud, sometimes with a small human figure for scale | Last page of manual — the finished KALLAX, BILLY, or MALM |
| Tool requirements | Row of tool silhouettes at the top of the page: Allen wrench, Phillips screwdriver, hammer — each drawn at recognizable scale | First page tool checklist |
| Connection detail | Zoomed circular inset showing exactly how Tab A inserts into Slot B, with arrow showing direction and click indicator | Cam lock detail, dowel insertion, shelf pin placement |
| Multi-person action | Two faceless figures cooperating — one holding, one attaching — with arrows showing each person's role | "This step requires two people" illustrated |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | IKEA Manual Metaphor |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Data/information | Individual hardware pieces (screws, dowels, panels) — discrete countable components |
| Processes | Numbered sequential panels showing one action per step, strict left-to-right reading order |
| Systems | Exploded assembly view showing all components and how they connect when brought together |
| Connections | Dotted alignment lines showing where Part A meets Part B, cam locks and dowels as literal connectors |
| Growth | Progressive assembly — from loose parts (step 1) to complete structure (final step) |
| Time | Panel sequence numbering: 1, 2, 3... each number a discrete moment in the assembly timeline |
| Hierarchy | Size and visual weight: the main furniture piece large and central, hardware small and peripheral |
| Tools/methods | Allen wrench, screwdriver, hammer silhouettes — the instruments of transformation |
| Errors/risks | Red X marks and circle-slash prohibition symbols over incorrect actions |
| Collaboration | Two faceless figures working together, one holding while the other attaches |
| Verification | Checkmark or implied "done" state — assembled joint with click-starburst indicator |
| Quantity | Multiplication notation: x4, x8, x16 next to hardware pieces |
| Scale | Human hand or full figure shown alongside object for size reference |
| Completion | Final panel showing pristine assembled product, clean and complete |

## Typography

- Clean sans-serif only — Futura, IKEA's Noto Sans, or similar geometric sans
- Numbers are the primary text: step numbers in circles, hardware quantities, panel/part codes (A, B, C)
- Minimal actual words — the entire point is wordless communication
- When text appears: short labels in lowercase, small point size, unobtrusive
- Measurement numbers in a precise technical style, always with units (mm, cm)
- Part codes in uppercase: A, B, C, D or AA, AB, AC
- NO decorative type, NO bold headlines, NO expressive typography — text is purely functional annotation
- If a title exists, it is the product name in clean small caps at the top of page one

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT a comic strip** — IKEA manuals have no narrative, no expressions, no drama. Each panel is a discrete technical instruction, not a story beat. No speech bubbles, no emotional faces.
- **NOT architectural blueprint** — blueprints are precise scaled plans with dimension lines. IKEA manuals are simplified pictograms with no measurements shown to the user (measurements are embedded in the engineering, not the consumer instructions).
- **NOT isometric-technical style** — isometric technical uses consistent 30-degree axonometric projection, cutaway views, and engineering callouts. IKEA manuals use simple three-quarter views with no strict projection rules, prioritizing instant readability over geometric precision.
- **NOT patent-drawing style** — patent drawings use crosshatch shading, reference numerals, and dense technical annotation. IKEA manuals are cleaner, simpler, with minimal annotation.
- **NOT LEGO instructions** — LEGO uses color-coded new pieces per step and precise stud-counting grids. IKEA uses black-and-white line drawings with motion arrows and no color on the furniture itself.
- **NOT a cartoon or illustration** — no personality, no style flourishes, no artistic expression. The aesthetic is deliberately anonymous, invisible, purely utilitarian.
- **NOT cluttered** — if a panel has more than one action, it has too much. IKEA's genius is one thing at a time. Generous white space is essential.
- This must look like it was printed on cheap newsprint paper inside a flat-pack box — thin black lines, faceless figures, numbered circles, motion arrows, red X warnings, and vast expanses of white nothing.

## Best For

Step-by-step tutorials, assembly and setup guides, onboarding processes, how-to instructions for any complexity level, DIY project documentation, recipe steps, exercise routines, any sequential process that benefits from wordless universal clarity, cross-language communication, technical procedures for non-technical audiences.
