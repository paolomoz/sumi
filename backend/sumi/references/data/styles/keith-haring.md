Thick black outlines dancing across the surface, radiant babies crawling and glowing, barking dogs with lines shooting from their snouts, faceless figures with arms raised in universal gesture — this is subway chalk on black paper, nightclub energy frozen in iconic form. Every figure outlined in confident black marker, filled with solid flat color (or left empty), radiating motion lines pulsing with life. Joyful, urgent, democratic street art elevated to visual language.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Jet black (#000000) for all outlines — THE defining element, thick confident strokes
- Fills: Signal red (#FF0000), sunshine yellow (#FFFF00), electric green (#00FF00), hot pink (#FF69B4), true blue (#0000FF), orange (#FF8C00)
- Background: White (#FFFFFF), black (#000000), or single solid color field
- Radiant lines: Always black, or same color as the figure's outline if on dark ground
- Text: Black outlines only, or reversed white on black — never colored text

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Subway Chalk | White figures on black background — the original public art aesthetic, chalk on the city |
| Primary Energy | Red + yellow + blue figures with black outlines on white — maximum pop and universal readability |
| Neon Night | Hot pink + electric green + orange with black outlines on white — nightclub/80s energy |
| Monochrome | Single color (red or yellow) + black outlines + white background — focused iconic impact |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Radiant** | Figures with motion/energy lines radiating outward, the "radiant baby" glow | Short parallel lines shooting out from figure edges — 3-5 lines per burst, indicating movement, energy, life force, importance |
| **Crowd** | Densely packed figures, interlocking bodies, no empty space | Figures filling every inch, arms and legs overlapping, a tapestry of human forms in different solid colors, all outlined in black |
| **Icon** | Single bold figure centered, maximum impact, logo-like simplicity | One barking dog, one radiant baby, one dancing figure — isolated on white or color ground, monumental and immediate |
| **Mural** | Sprawling composition, figures interacting across the full canvas | Figures crawling over, dancing with, connecting to each other in a continuous narrative flow across the entire frame |

## Visual Elements

- **Thick black outlines** — the absolute core of the style. 6-10px confident strokes around every figure, consistent weight, no thin lines. If it doesn't have thick black outlines, it's not Haring
- **Radiant/motion lines** — short parallel lines (3-5 per burst) radiating from figure edges, heads, hands, indicating energy, movement, importance. Signature element after outlines
- **Faceless figures** — humans without facial features, just a head shape. Identity through pose and gesture, not expression
- **Raised arms** — figures with both arms up in celebration, unity, energy — the universal gesture of joy and engagement
- **Crawling babies** — the iconic "radiant baby" on hands and knees, lines radiating from the whole body, symbol of innocence and life force
- **Barking dogs** — simplified dog form with open mouth, lines shooting from the snout indicating bark/sound, often shown with human figures
- **Dancing figures** — bodies in dynamic motion, legs apart, arms swinging, captured mid-movement
- **Pyramids of figures** — humans stacked on each other's shoulders, or arranged in geometric human formations
- **Interlocking bodies** — figures whose limbs connect, wrap around, or flow into each other, human connection made literal
- **Heart shapes** — simple heart forms, often held by figures or radiating from chests
- **Solid flat color fills** — figures filled with one solid color each, no gradients, no shading, different figures different colors
- **X marks** — figures sometimes marked with X symbols, or X shapes as design elements

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Large central figure with radiant lines, smaller figures below or around paying attention/responding | Radiant baby as focal point, crowd of smaller figures reacting |
| Flow/process | Figures moving left-to-right in sequence, each in a stage of action, connected by the flow of motion | Dancing figures in a line, a visual conga of process steps |
| Connections | Figures with interlocking arms, holding hands, limbs connecting across the composition | Chain of humans, each holding the next, or stacked pyramid |
| Cycles | Figures arranged in a circle, all moving in the same rotational direction, or radiant figure at center of circular arrangement | Ring of dancing figures, or radiant baby as sun with orbiting forms |
| Comparison | Two figures facing each other, gestures indicating difference — one arms up, one arms down | Contrasting poses showing contrasting states |
| Categories | Each category as a different figure type (baby, dog, dancer, etc.) each in its own solid color | Haring's icon vocabulary — baby for growth, dog for loyalty, etc. |
| Energy | Maximum radiant lines, starburst of short black strokes, figures in explosive motion poses | The more radiant lines, the more energy conveyed |
| Unity | All figures the same, all arms raised, all in the same pose — collective identity | Crowd of identical figures, differentiated only by fill color |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Keith Haring Metaphor |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Data/information | Number of radiant lines — more lines = more importance/energy |
| Processes | Chain of dancing figures, each in sequential pose of action |
| Systems | Interlocking figures, limbs connecting, bodies supporting each other |
| Connections | Figures holding hands, or barking dog connecting two humans |
| Growth | Crawling radiant baby — innocence, new life, emerging energy |
| Time | Left-to-right sequence of figures in progressive poses |
| Hierarchy | Larger figure with more radiant lines at top/center, smaller figures around |
| Protection | Figure with arms forming protective arch over smaller figure |
| Speed | Running figure with extra radiant/motion lines trailing behind |
| Stability | Figure planted with legs apart, arms down, solid and grounded |
| Users/people | Faceless human figures — identity through action, not features |
| Ideas | Radiant head, or figure with lightbulb shape radiating from skull area |
| Energy | Maximum radiant lines, both arms raised, body in dynamic pose |
| Community | Crowd of interlocking figures, pyramid of stacked humans |
| Communication | Barking dog (broadcasting), figures with lines between them |

## Typography

- Bold sans-serif, thick strokes matching the figure outlines
- ALL CAPS preferred — matches the bold graphic energy
- Letters can be outlined in thick black and filled with solid color, like the figures
- Text treated as graphic shape, integrated with figures
- Words can curve, stack, or arrange playfully — not rigid layouts
- Black text on white, or white reversed out of black
- Type should feel hand-painted, confident, urgent — like protest sign lettering
- Never thin, elegant, or decorative — always bold and immediate

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT detailed** — Haring figures have NO interior detail. No faces, no clothes patterns, no anatomical features. Pure silhouette with outline.
- **NOT thin lines** — The thick black outline is EVERYTHING. Thin, delicate lines destroy the entire aesthetic. Go bolder than you think.
- **NOT gradient or shaded** — Fills are 100% solid flat color. No blending, no dimensional shading, no gradients anywhere.
- **NOT realistic** — Figures are abstracted to their most basic form. If it looks anatomically correct, you've gone too far.
- **NOT static** — Figures should feel alive, in motion, radiating energy. Static, planted poses miss the kinetic joy of the style.
- **NOT isolated without energy** — Even a single figure needs radiant lines. Without the motion/energy lines, it's just a silhouette, not Haring.
- **NOT Basquiat** — Basquiat is raw, scratchy, text-heavy, crown motifs. Haring is clean outlines, smooth fills, radiant energy.
- **NOT Banksy** — Banksy is stencil-based, political commentary, photographic detail. Haring is continuous line, universal symbols, pure form.
- **NOT Memphis** — Memphis is pattern-on-pattern chaos, zigzags and terrazzo. Haring is clean solid fills with thick outlines, no patterns.

## Reference Images

- Reference: Radiant Baby (crawling infant with energy lines), Barking Dog (dog with sound lines), Pop Shop designs (dancing figures), Crack is Wack mural (crowd of figures), NYC subway drawings (white chalk on black)
- Look for: Thick black outlines on everything, radiant/motion lines shooting from figures, faceless human forms, raised arms, solid flat color fills, interlocking figures

## Best For

Community topics, youth engagement, social causes, health campaigns, dance/music/movement content, unity and solidarity messaging, educational content for general audiences, anything needing democratic accessibility and joyful energy, public service messaging, crowd/community visualization.
