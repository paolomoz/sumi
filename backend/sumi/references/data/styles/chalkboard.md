# chalkboard

White and colored chalk scraped across dark green or black slate — the visual language of every classroom ever, from grade school arithmetic to university physics lectures. Dusty strokes and smudged erasures, imperfect handwriting that carries the authority of the teacher's gesture, diagrams drawn in real-time with stick figures and arrows explaining everything from photosynthesis to supply and demand. This is knowledge transfer at its most direct: the board, the chalk, the teacher's hand, the students watching. Authenticity in the imperfection, authority in the ephemeral marks that will be erased and redrawn tomorrow.

## Color Palette

- Background: Dark slate green (#2B4B3C), classic blackboard (#1A1A1A), blue-black (#1C2541)
- Primary chalk: Pure white (#FFFFFF) with dusty edges, cream (#FFFDD0) for softer white chalk
- Colored chalks: Dusty yellow (#F4D03F), dusty pink (#E8A0BF), dusty blue (#87CEEB), dusty orange (#E8A87C)
- Accents: Bright yellow (#FFEB3B) for emphasis, red (#FF6B6B) for corrections or warnings
- Erased areas: Smudged gray-green (#445544), ghosted remnants of previous writing
- Chalk dust: Scattered particles, dusty haze around text edges

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Classic Green | Slate green + white chalk + yellow accent — the traditional school palette |
| Blackboard | True black + white + single colored chalk — maximum contrast, serious education |
| Full Color | Green or black + white + multiple colored chalks — comprehensive teaching diagram |
| Vintage Slate | Blue-black slate + cream chalk — historical, slightly more elegant |
| Café Menu | Black board + white and colored chalks — contemporary chalkboard menu style |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Classroom** | Teaching diagrams with hand-drawn quality | Math equations, scientific diagrams, labeled illustrations, the teacher's board |
| **Menu Board** | Café/restaurant menu aesthetic | Decorative lettering, illustrations of food items, pricing, artistic chalkboard art |
| **Lecture** | Dense academic content, university-level | Complex equations, multiple diagrams, serious educational content |
| **Sketch** | Rough planning and ideation | Quick sketches, crossed-out ideas, arrows, circled highlights — brainstorming aesthetic |
| **Decorative** | Artistic chalk illustration | Elaborate lettering, detailed drawings, the skilled chalk artist's work |

## Visual Elements

- **Chalk texture** — thick, dusty, slightly uneven strokes with visible grain and chalk particle scatter
- **Hand-lettered text** — imperfect handwriting, slightly slanted, the teacher's natural hand
- **Smudged areas** — erased content leaving ghostly traces, imperfect erasing
- **Stick figures** — simple human representations for explanations
- **Arrows everywhere** — connecting ideas, showing flow, indicating relationships
- **Underlines and emphasis** — important terms underlined, sometimes multiple times
- **Boxes and circles** — key concepts boxed, important items circled
- **Diagonal slash-throughs** — corrections, crossed-out mistakes left visible
- **Numbers and letters** — labels for diagrams, sequential points, mathematical notation
- **Dashed lines** — auxiliary lines, hidden edges, construction geometry
- **Chalk dust** — particles scattered around text, dusty halos, atmospheric chalk debris
- **Board edge visible** — the frame of the board anchoring the composition
- **Varying pressure** — thick confident strokes vs. light sketchy lines

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Larger text for titles, progressive indentation for sub-points | Lecture outline, numbered lists |
| Flow/process | Arrows connecting sequential steps, left-to-right or top-to-bottom | Chemical reactions, historical timelines, cause-and-effect |
| Connections | Lines and arrows connecting related concepts | Mind maps, relationship diagrams |
| Cycles | Circular arrow diagrams, feedback loops | Natural cycles, iterative processes |
| Comparison | Split board with different concepts on each side, labels and divider | Compare/contrast, before/after |
| Categories | Boxed groups of related items, labeled sections | Classification diagrams, grouped lists |
| Math/Science | Equations, graphs, geometric figures with construction lines | Problem solving, proofs, scientific explanation |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Chalkboard Metaphor |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Data/information | Density of chalked content — fuller boards = more information |
| Processes | Sequential steps connected by arrows, numbered stages |
| Systems | Interconnected diagrams with arrows showing relationships |
| Connections | Lines and arrows explicitly linking concepts |
| Growth | Progression from left to right, building complexity |
| Time | Linear timeline, sequential panels, cause-effect arrows |
| Hierarchy | Size and position — larger and higher = more important |
| Revision | Crossed-out content, erased and rewritten areas |
| Emphasis | Underlines, boxes, circles, multiple strokes |
| Questions | Question marks, dotted lines to unknowns |
| Users/people | Simple stick figures, labeled "you," "user," "student" |
| Ideas | Light bulb sketch, thought bubble, starred items |
| Problems | X marks, red/yellow chalk warnings, circled errors |

## Typography

- **Handwritten** — natural teacher's handwriting, imperfect, characterful, readable
- **Uppercase for emphasis** — important terms, titles, labels
- **Mixed case for body** — natural sentence case, matching hand-lettered style
- **Chalk scripts** — decorative lettering for menu boards, skilled chalk artist's work
- **Scientific notation** — proper mathematical and scientific symbols as handwritten
- **Consistent slant** — most natural chalk writing has a slight forward lean
- **Size variation** — titles larger, notes smaller, labels compact
- **Underlines** — frequently used for emphasis, sometimes wavy or double

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT digital or clean** — the entire point is handmade imperfection, never vector-perfect
- **NOT thin or precise** — chalk strokes are thick, dusty, variable. No hairlines.
- **NOT colorful** — limited palette, mostly white with occasional colored chalk accents
- **NOT permanent** — the aesthetic includes erasures, corrections, the ephemeral nature of chalk
- **NOT decorative background** — the dark board is functional, not ornamental
- **NOT isometric or technical** — diagrams are sketchy and explanatory, not engineering drawings
- **NOT typeset** — even beautiful chalk lettering shows the hand, never looks printed
- This must look like an actual classroom chalkboard — dusty, imperfect, pedagogical, authentic — not a dark background with white text.

## Best For

Educational content, explanatory diagrams, teaching and tutorial material, restaurant/café menus, brainstorming and ideation visualization, step-by-step processes, mathematical and scientific concepts, nostalgic school themes, informal professional presentations.
