# isotype

Rows of identical simplified human figures standing shoulder to shoulder, each one a solid-color silhouette representing a thousand people — this is Otto Neurath's ISOTYPE (International System of Typographic Picture Education), the 1930s Vienna Method of pictorial statistics. Every concept reduced to a single bold pictogram: a factory smokestack for industry, a wheat sheaf for agriculture, a simplified human figure for population. Quantities shown by REPEATING the same icon, never by making one icon bigger. Clean, democratic, universally legible visual language — statistics that a factory worker and a professor read with equal ease.

## Color Palette

- Primary: ISOTYPE red (#C1272D), ISOTYPE blue (#1B75BC), charcoal black (#231F20)
- Background: Warm ivory (#FAF3E3) or clean white (#FFFFFF) — never dark backgrounds, always light ground for maximum pictogram legibility
- Accents: Olive green (#5B7C3A), warm amber (#D4941A), steel gray (#7B8D97) — used as category differentiators, one color per pictogram type
- Fills: Every pictogram is a SOLID flat fill, single color, no outlines, no strokes — the shape itself IS the icon
- Text: Black (#231F20) only, clean and functional, never decorative

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Classic Vienna | Red + black + ivory background — the original Gesellschaftsmuseum palette, maximum clarity and warmth |
| Statistical | Blue + red + black on white — two-variable comparison, cool vs. warm for instant categorical reading |
| Industrial | Black + olive green + amber on ivory — factories, agriculture, resources — the economic survey palette |
| Monochrome | Single color (red or black) + ivory background — maximum simplicity, one variable, pure counting |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Population** | Rows of identical human figures, each representing a unit of population | Simplified standing human pictograms in neat horizontal rows, each figure identical, quantity shown purely by COUNT — 5 figures means 5 units. Rows aligned to a baseline grid, left-aligned like text |
| **Industrial** | Factory icons, production symbols, economic pictograms | Simplified factory buildings with smokestacks, gear wheels, railroad cars, ships — each a bold flat silhouette. Quantities by repetition: 3 factory icons = 3 units of production. Clean category rows |
| **Comparative** | Side-by-side rows comparing two or more categories by color | Multiple rows stacked vertically, each row a different color representing a different category, lengths of rows directly comparable — longer row = more. The original bar chart made human-readable |
| **Timeline** | Horizontal time axis with pictogram rows growing/shrinking across decades | Left-to-right progression with year labels, pictogram rows lengthening or shortening to show change over time, each time period a column of pictograms |

## Visual Elements

- **Identical repeated pictograms** — the core ISOTYPE principle: show quantity by REPEATING the same icon, never by scaling it. Five human figures = 5,000 people. Three factory icons = 3 units of production. Every pictogram in a row is EXACTLY the same size, shape, and color
- **Bold flat silhouette icons** — every pictogram is a solid filled shape with NO outline, NO stroke, NO internal detail. A human figure is a solid red or black silhouette. A factory is a solid black shape. Shapes are simplified to the minimum needed for instant recognition
- **Strict horizontal row alignment** — pictograms arranged in neat left-aligned horizontal rows on a baseline grid. Like lines of text, reading left to right. Rows stacked vertically for comparison. This is NOT a scattered composition — it is orderly, grid-based, systematic
- **One pictogram type per row** — each row contains only one type of icon (all human figures, or all factories, or all wheat sheaves). Rows labeled on the left with a category name
- **Category labels on the left margin** — simple text labels identifying what each row represents, aligned vertically like a Y-axis legend, clean and functional
- **Proportional counting** — each pictogram equals a fixed unit (e.g., 1 figure = 1,000 people). Half-pictograms (a figure cut in half vertically) represent half-units. Never quarter or other fractions — only full and half
- **Warm ivory or white backgrounds** — clean, uncluttered ground. NO textures, NO gradients, NO decorative elements. The background is empty space
- **Generous spacing between pictograms** — icons do not touch or overlap. Clear breathing room between each figure, each row. Legibility above all
- **Simple geometric construction** — every pictogram built from basic shapes (circles, rectangles, triangles) combined into recognizable forms. A person = circle head + rectangle body + triangle base. A house = triangle roof + rectangle walls
- **NO decorative elements** — no borders, no ornamental frames, no embellishments, no flourishes. Pure functional clarity. If an element does not convey data, it does not exist
- **NO outlines on pictograms** — this is critical. ISOTYPE icons are solid filled shapes, not outlined shapes. The edge of the color IS the edge of the icon. No black stroke around anything
- **Partial pictograms for remainders** — a pictogram clipped vertically at exactly the halfway point to show a half-unit. The clip is a clean vertical cut, not a fade or gradient

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Rows of different lengths stacked vertically — longest row (most important/largest) at top, shortest at bottom, instantly readable by row length | Neurath's population charts — country rows ordered by size |
| Flow/process | Left-to-right sequence of pictogram types changing across columns, each column a stage, pictograms transforming from raw material icon to finished product icon | Economic transformation diagrams — wheat becomes bread becomes consumption |
| Comparison | Multiple rows of the same pictogram type in different colors, stacked vertically, row lengths directly comparable — the visual equivalent of a horizontal bar chart | Neurath's country-by-country comparisons — red rows vs. blue rows |
| Categories | Each category its own row with its own unique pictogram shape and color, all left-aligned from the same margin for easy length comparison | Industry sectors: factory row, wheat row, ship row, each in its own color |
| Growth/change | Same pictogram rows shown across time columns, the row getting longer (more icons) in later time periods, clearly showing increase | Population growth: 1900 = 3 figures, 1920 = 5 figures, 1940 = 8 figures |
| Proportions | Rows of pictograms where colored and uncolored (or two-color) icons within the same row show a ratio — 7 red + 3 blue out of 10 = 70%/30% | Ratio visualization — filled vs unfilled pictograms in one row |
| Parts of whole | Grid of identical pictograms (e.g., 10x10 = 100 figures), some colored differently to show the proportion belonging to a subcategory | 100-figure grids with highlighted subsets |
| Geographic | Simple map outline with pictogram rows placed at geographic locations, quantity still shown by repetition not size | Neurath's maps — factory icons placed at industrial centers |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | ISOTYPE Metaphor |
|------------------|------------------|
| Data/information | Count of repeated identical pictograms — more icons = more data |
| Processes | Left-to-right sequence of different pictogram types: input icon transforms to output icon |
| Systems | Grid of interconnected pictogram rows, each row a subsystem, all aligned to the same baseline |
| Connections | Rows sharing the same pictogram shape but different colors, indicating related categories |
| Growth | Row getting longer over time — more pictograms in later time columns |
| Time | Left-to-right axis with year labels, pictogram rows as columns showing state at each time point |
| Hierarchy | Row length = importance. Longest row at top, shortest at bottom. No size variation in individual icons |
| Protection | Shield pictogram or enclosed row, simple but immediately recognizable |
| Speed | More pictograms appearing per time unit — density increase across timeline columns |
| Stability | Consistent row lengths across time columns — unchanging quantity |
| Users/people | The simplified standing human figure — circle head, solid body, the universal ISOTYPE person, always the same size |
| Ideas | Lightbulb pictogram or book pictogram, repeated for quantity |
| Energy | Lightning bolt pictogram or flame pictogram, same solid silhouette style |
| Quantity | Pure repetition: 1 icon = 1 unit. The icon IS the number. No abstract numerals needed |
| Categories | Different pictogram shapes in different colors, each type its own row |

## Typography

- Clean sans-serif, Futura or similar geometric typeface — functional, modern, legible
- Lowercase preferred — approachable and democratic, matching ISOTYPE's educational mission
- Labels placed at the left margin of each pictogram row, right-aligned to a consistent indent
- Title in slightly larger weight of the same typeface, never decorative
- Numbers used sparingly — the pictograms ARE the numbers. Only use digits for the legend key ("= 1,000 people")
- Black text only — never colored, never competing with the pictogram colors
- Generous line spacing, never cramped — everything breathes
- NO ornamental type, NO serif faces, NO hand-drawn lettering — pure functional clarity
- Axis labels (years, categories) in regular weight, titles in bold — minimal hierarchy

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT modern infographic icons** — Modern infographics use varied-size icons, gradient fills, outlines, detailed illustrations, and decorative elements. ISOTYPE pictograms are SOLID FLAT SILHOUETTES, all the same size, with NO outlines and NO internal detail. If it looks like a modern icon set from Noun Project or Font Awesome, it is WRONG.
- **NOT a bar chart or pie chart** — ISOTYPE deliberately replaces abstract chart forms with concrete pictorial counting. If you see bars, axes, pie wedges, or line graphs, you have missed the entire point. Quantity is shown by COUNTING ICONS, not by abstract geometric shapes.
- **NOT scaled icons** — This is the MOST COMMON mistake. In ISOTYPE, you NEVER make one icon bigger than another to show "more." Every icon is IDENTICAL in size. Quantity is shown ONLY by repetition (more icons = more). **A big person and a small person is NOT ISOTYPE. Five identical persons is ISOTYPE.**
- **NOT Paul Rand** — Paul Rand uses geometric playfulness, visual puns, and witty shape-letter substitutions. ISOTYPE is dead serious about data communication — no puns, no cleverness, no aesthetic games. Pure statistical clarity.
- **NOT Keith Haring** — Haring's figures are dynamic, dancing, radiating energy lines. ISOTYPE figures are static, standing neutrally, showing nothing but quantity through repetition.
- **NOT pixel art** — Though both use grid-based placement, pixel art is decorative and playful. ISOTYPE is functional and statistical.
- **NOT scattered or organic** — Every pictogram is in a precise row on a baseline grid. Nothing floats, nothing overlaps, nothing is randomly placed. The strict grid IS the ISOTYPE identity.
- **NOT outlined** — ISOTYPE pictograms have NO black outlines. They are pure solid-color silhouettes. Adding outlines transforms them into a different visual language entirely.
- This must look like a 1930s Vienna museum wall chart explaining steel production to workers — rows of identical red factory icons on ivory paper, each icon representing 10,000 tons, legible from across the room — not a decorative illustration or a modern dashboard.

## Best For

Statistical comparisons, population data, production/economic data, before/after quantities, educational explainers, democratic data visualization, cross-cultural communication, quantity-focused storytelling, survey results, simple ratio communication, any content where counting concrete icons is clearer than reading abstract numbers.
