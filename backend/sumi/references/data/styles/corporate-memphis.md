# corporate-memphis

The flat illustration style that colonized every tech company website circa 2018-2022 — blobby humans with tiny heads and disproportionately long limbs in purple, blue, and coral, floating in abstract spaces doing vaguely collaborative things. Hands always gesturing meaningfully, everyone perpetually diverse in a carefully calculated way, organic blob shapes softening every corner. This is the visual esperanto of Silicon Valley, designed to feel friendly and inclusive while saying nothing specific. Gradients are gentle, shadows don't exist, and everyone looks happy about synergy. Love it or hate it, it defined an era of digital illustration.

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Tech Standard | Purple + coral + teal + yellow on white — the canonical Big Tech palette |
| Healthcare Soft | Teal + soft pink + light blue + white — calming, trustworthy, medical-adjacent |
| Fintech Bold | Deep purple + coral + white + touches of gold — professional but friendly money |
| Education Warm | Yellow + coral + teal + diverse skin tones — welcoming and inclusive learning |
| Startup Energy | Coral + purple + bright yellow + mint — energetic and optimistic disruption |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Collaborative** | Multiple figures working together in abstract space | Tiny-headed long-limbed humans around tables, screens, whiteboards, gesturing and smiling, floating objects |
| **Individual** | Single figure doing a task or achieving a goal | One character center stage, oversized objects (phone, laptop, checkmark), celebratory poses |
| **Abstract** | Emphasis on shapes and objects, minimal or no humans | Floating geometric and organic shapes, hands emerging from edges, devices and UI elements |
| **Scene** | Multiple characters in a suggested environment | Office space, city, nature — but flattened and abstracted, no realistic perspective |
| **Icon** | Simplified symbolic elements in the Corporate Memphis color palette | Objects and concepts as flat colorful icons with blob backgrounds |

## Visual Elements

- **Tiny heads, long limbs** — the signature human proportion: small heads, elongated arms and legs, simplified features
- **Diverse skin tones** — always multiple skin colors represented, flat and unshaded, carefully inclusive
- **Organic blob shapes** — rounded, irregular forms in the background, no sharp corners anywhere
- **Flat colors with gentle gradients** — no harsh shadows, smooth transitions between colors
- **Meaningful hand gestures** — hands pointing, waving, high-fiving, holding objects, always expressive
- **Oversized objects** — phones, laptops, gears, lightbulbs, checkmarks scaled larger than realistic
- **Floating compositions** — elements suspended in white or gradient space, no ground plane necessary
- **Abstract facial features** — simple dots for eyes, small curved mouths, minimal detail
- **Squiggly lines and dots** — decorative elements adding texture and playfulness
- **No outlines or thin outlines** — shapes defined by color fills, occasionally soft colored outlines
- **Happy, active poses** — standing, walking, jumping, celebrating — never static or sad
- **Collaboration signifiers** — puzzle pieces, handshakes, group formations, shared screens

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Larger figure or element at center, smaller supporting elements arranged around | Hero character surrounded by floating tools and shapes |
| Flow/process | Left-to-right progression of figures or objects, connected by lines or shared space | Pipeline visualization with characters at each stage |
| Connections | Figures reaching toward each other, hands touching, puzzle pieces interlocking | Collaboration scene, network of connected people |
| Cycles | Circular arrangement of figures or objects, implied rotation | Agile sprint, continuous improvement loop |
| Comparison | Side-by-side figures or scenes, before/after states | Feature comparison, plan tiers, transformation |
| Categories | Grid of icon-like elements, each category a distinct color or object | Feature list, service offerings, team skills |
| Growth | Figures climbing stairs, graphs trending up, progressively larger elements | Success story, growth metrics, achievement unlocked |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Corporate Memphis Metaphor |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Data/information | Floating documents, graph shapes, screen displays with abstract data |
| Processes | Pipeline of connected stations, figures walking through stages |
| Systems | Interlocking gears, puzzle pieces coming together, network diagrams |
| Connections | Hands reaching, figures grouped, lines connecting nodes |
| Growth | Upward stairs, rising graph lines, figure celebrating at top of mountain |
| Time | Left-to-right progression, clock/calendar elements, sequential poses |
| Hierarchy | Size and vertical position — bigger and higher = more important |
| Protection | Shield shapes, umbrella over figures, enclosing curves |
| Speed | Running figure, horizontal motion lines, paper airplane |
| Stability | Grounded stance, solid platform beneath figures, contained compositions |
| Users/people | The tiny-headed, long-limbed diverse humans are the users |
| Ideas | Lightbulb (often oversized), thought bubble, sparks around head |
| Energy | Radiating lines, burst shapes, jumping/celebrating poses |
| Success | Checkmark (usually large), trophy, confetti, arms raised |

## Typography

- Rounded sans-serif fonts — Google Sans, Circular, Product Sans, Nunito — soft and friendly
- Medium to bold weights — confident but not aggressive
- Generous letter-spacing — open, breathable, optimistic
- Lowercase preference for body, sentence case for headlines — approachable
- White or dark gray on solid backgrounds, colored text sparingly for accent
- Clean, legible, unadorned — the typography doesn't compete with the illustration
- Often integrated with illustrations — text as part of scenes, labels connected to elements

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT detailed or realistic** — everything is abstracted, simplified, flattened. No rendering, no texture.
- **NOT outlined** — shapes are defined by flat color fills, not outlines. Occasionally soft matching outlines, never black.
- **NOT moody or dark** — the palette is bright, optimistic, tech-positive. No shadows, no drama.
- **NOT specific** — environments are abstract, activities are generic. It's collaboration, not what they're collaborating on.
- **NOT edgy or provocative** — this style is designed for mass appeal and brand safety. Nothing controversial.
- **NOT skeuomorphic** — no 3D effects, no realistic textures, no drop shadows. Aggressively flat.
- **NOT Memphis design** — despite the name, this is not the 1980s Memphis Group. No clashing patterns, no terrazzo, no geometric chaos.
- This must look like a Slack or Asana website illustration — optimistic, inclusive, flat, purple, with tiny-headed humans doing abstract teamwork in blobby pastel spaces.

## Best For
