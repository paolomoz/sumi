# bauhaus

Bold, expressive geometric art inspired by the Bauhaus school (1919-1933) and Kandinsky's abstract compositions. Rich overlapping forms, sweeping diagonal energy, luminous color halos, and dramatic architectural perspectives — geometric abstraction as fine art, not clinical diagram.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Saturated red, cadmium yellow, deep ultramarine blue
- Extended: Teal, olive green, purple, rose pink, burnt orange — the full Bauhaus teaching palette
- Background: Warm cream, aged parchment, soft ochre wash — never sterile white
- Blacks: Dense, velvety black for bold circles, sweeping lines, and dramatic contrast
- Accents: Colored halos and rings around circles (pink glow around black, blue aura around yellow)

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Kandinsky | Saturated red + cadmium yellow + ultramarine blue + purple + cream ground, with colored halos around geometric forms |
| Architectural | Teal + warm yellow + deep black + terracotta red, bold flat planes with dramatic shadows |
| Expressive | Rose pink + olive green + burnt orange + deep blue + black, overlapping translucent layers |
| Poster | Black + single bold primary (red or yellow or teal) + cream, high contrast with architectural drama |
| Mosaic | Full rainbow of saturated hues — red, orange, yellow, green, blue, teal — in interlocking quarter-circles and geometric tiles |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Kandinsky** | Sweeping abstract compositions with musical energy | Large circles with colored halos floating against cream backgrounds, thin precise lines shooting diagonally across the canvas, arcs and curves in tension with sharp angles, checkerboard fragments, overlapping translucent colored planes creating depth |
| **Poster** | Bold architectural drama with flat color planes | Dramatic one-point perspective, large flat color blocks (teal walls, yellow sky, black shadows), a single red accent object, strong geometric buildings and stairs, Bauhaus exhibition poster aesthetic |
| **Face** | Human features abstracted into bold geometric collage | Overlapping triangles, circles, and arrows composing a portrait — eyes as concentric rings, nose as sharp triangle, bold saturated color blocks fragmenting the face, cubist-meets-Bauhaus energy |
| **Constructivist** | Dynamic diagonal compositions in red and black | Aggressive diagonal thrust, mechanical and architectural forms, bold red triangles and black bars slashing across the composition, Lissitzky-inspired revolutionary energy |
| **Mosaic** | Interlocking geometric tile patterns | Quarter-circles and semicircles fitting together like a puzzle in saturated primary and secondary colors, modular and rhythmic, bold and joyful, op-art optical energy |

## Visual Elements

- Large bold circles with luminous colored halos or rings radiating outward (pink glow, blue aura, yellow corona)
- Sweeping thin black lines shooting diagonally across the entire composition, creating dynamic tension
- Overlapping translucent geometric planes — triangles, circles, rectangles layered so colors blend where they intersect
- Checkerboard fragments and grid patterns woven into the composition as textural accents
- Dramatic arcs and curves in counterpoint with sharp angular lines
- Dense, saturated color — not pale or washed out, but rich and bold
- Warm cream or parchment-toned backgrounds with subtle tonal variation, never flat sterile white
- Bold flat architectural color planes with dramatic cast shadows
- Faces and figures constructed from overlapping geometric shapes — triangular noses, circular eyes with concentric rings, arrow-shaped hair
- Interlocking quarter-circles and semicircles creating mosaic-like tile compositions
- Fine precise parallel lines (in groups of 2-3) running at angles across forms
- Small geometric accents scattered rhythmically — tiny triangles, dots, semicircles at intersections

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Large dominant circle at top with radiating halo, smaller forms cascading below along sweeping diagonal lines | Kandinsky's Composition VIII — the large black circle with pink halo commanding the upper left |
| Flow/process | Sweeping diagonal thrust from lower-left to upper-right, geometric forms tumbling along the movement axis, arcs marking transitions | Lissitzky's Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge — dynamic directional energy |
| Connections | Fine thin lines connecting circles of different colors, creating a constellation-like web of relationships across the canvas | Kandinsky's network of precise lines linking floating geometric forms |
| Cycles | Concentric circles within a containing circle, overlapping colored arcs rotating around a center point | Kandinsky's Circles in a Circle — contained yet dynamic rotational energy |
| Comparison | Bold vertical division with contrasting color temperatures — warm saturated left vs. cool deep right, mirrored geometric forms on each side | Yellow-Red-Blue's triptych color structure |
| Categories | Distinct geometric forms (circle, triangle, square) each in their own saturated color, arranged as overlapping mosaic tiles | Bauhaus color-form theory rendered as interlocking quarter-circle pattern |
| Growth | Expanding concentric rings with increasingly saturated halos, small to large progression along a diagonal | Circles growing outward with luminous colored auras |
| Networks | Grid of intersecting diagonal lines with colored circles at crossing points, each node glowing with its own halo | Composition VIII's field of geometric nodes connected by precise lines |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Bauhaus Metaphor |
|------------------|------------------|
| Data/information | Circles of proportional size with colored halos indicating category |
| Processes | Sweeping diagonal line carrying geometric forms from one state to another |
| Systems | Interlocking mosaic of quarter-circles and geometric tiles |
| Connections | Thin precise lines linking circles in constellation patterns |
| Growth | Concentric expanding rings with increasingly luminous halos |
| Time | Diagonal sweep from lower-left (past) to upper-right (future) |
| Hierarchy | Dominant large circle with halo at top, descending sizes below |
| Protection | Enclosing circle containing a composition (Circles in a Circle) |
| Speed | Sharp diagonal lines, arrow-triangles, dynamic angular thrust |
| Stability | Large dark circle anchoring the composition, horizontal architectural planes |
| Users/people | Faces and figures built from bold overlapping geometric shapes — eyes as concentric circles, features as triangles and arcs |
| Ideas | Radiating yellow triangle with luminous glow |
| Energy | Overlapping red and orange planes, explosive diagonal lines crossing |
| Tension/conflict | Curves fighting against straight lines, warm colors clashing with cool |

## Typography

- Bold geometric sans-serif with architectural weight
- Lowercase preference — clean, modern, confident
- Type placed as a bold compositional element — large titles integrated into the geometric field
- Text can sit on dramatic diagonal angles following the composition's energy
- Key words highlighted in saturated primary color against black or cream
- Lettering can overlap with geometric forms, partially occluded for artistic depth
- No decorative or serif faces — pure geometric letterforms

## Best For

Expressive visual storytelling, dramatic comparisons, architectural and spatial concepts, abstract relationship mapping, any content that benefits from bold artistic energy and dynamic geometric composition rather than sterile diagrams.
