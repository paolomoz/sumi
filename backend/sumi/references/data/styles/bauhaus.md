# bauhaus

Bold, expressive geometric art born from the Bauhaus school (1919-1933) — Kandinsky's cosmic circles radiating luminous colored halos against warm cream grounds, Moholy-Nagy's diagonal beams of light slicing through dark space, Klee's whimsical grids of translucent overlapping color, Albers' nested squares vibrating at their edges. Sweeping diagonal energy, overlapping translucent planes, checkerboard fragments, and dramatic architectural perspectives. This is geometric abstraction as fine art on gallery walls, not clinical corporate diagramming — every triangle is a spiritual force, every circle a celestial body, every line a tension between opposing energies.

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Kandinsky | Saturated red + cadmium yellow + ultramarine blue + purple + cream ground, with colored halos radiating around geometric forms — the Composition VIII palette |
| Architectural | Teal + warm yellow + dense black + terracotta red on cream, bold flat planes with dramatic cast shadows — Bauhaus building poster energy |
| Expressive | Rose pink + olive green + burnt orange + deep blue + black, overlapping translucent layers creating new colors at intersections |
| Poster | Black + single bold primary (red OR yellow OR teal) + cream — high contrast, exhibition announcement drama, Herbert Bayer typography |
| Mosaic | Full saturated spectrum — red, orange, yellow, green, blue, teal — in interlocking quarter-circles and geometric tiles on cream, Bauhaus wallpaper joy |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Kandinsky** | Sweeping abstract compositions with musical energy and cosmic tension | Large circles with colored halos floating against cream backgrounds, thin precise lines shooting diagonally across the canvas like violin strings, arcs and curves in tension with sharp angles, checkerboard fragments, overlapping translucent colored planes creating depth through transparency |
| **Poster** | Bold architectural drama with flat color planes and typographic power | Dramatic one-point perspective depth, large flat color blocks (teal wall, yellow sky, black shadow), a single red accent object, strong geometric buildings and stairs, Herbert Bayer exhibition poster aesthetic — image and text as one composition |
| **Face** | Human features abstracted into bold geometric collage | Overlapping triangles, circles, and arrow shapes composing a portrait — eyes as concentric rings with colored halos, nose as a sharp triangle, bold saturated color blocks fragmenting the face into cubist-Bauhaus geometry |
| **Constructivist** | Dynamic diagonal compositions in red and black | Aggressive diagonal thrust from lower-left to upper-right, mechanical and architectural forms, bold red triangles and black bars slashing across the composition — Lissitzky's "Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge" revolutionary energy |
| **Mosaic** | Interlocking geometric tile patterns, modular and rhythmic | Quarter-circles and semicircles fitting together like a puzzle in saturated primaries and secondaries, each tile a different color — modular, rhythmic, joyful, op-art optical energy at the seams where tiles meet |

## Visual Elements

- **Large bold circles with luminous colored halos** — a black circle radiating a soft pink glow, a yellow circle with a blue-violet aura, like celestial bodies. The halo is subtle but unmistakable, bleeding softly into the cream ground. This is the single most recognizable Kandinsky/Bauhaus element
- **Sweeping thin black lines shooting diagonally** across the entire composition, creating taut tension like tightrope wires or musical strings. They connect nothing; they create dynamic energy
- **Overlapping translucent geometric planes** — triangles, circles, rectangles layered so you see through them, colors blending where they intersect (red over blue = purple zone). Transparency reveals composition depth
- **Checkerboard fragments and grid patterns** woven into the composition as textural accents — never full checkerboards, just fragments visible through windows in overlapping forms
- **Dramatic arcs and curves** in counterpoint with sharp angular lines — a sweeping red arc fighting against a rigid black diagonal, creating visual music
- **Dense, richly saturated color** — not pale or washed out, not neon or digital, but the deep rich pigment of oil paint and screen printing. Cadmium red, ultramarine blue, the real thing
- **Warm cream or parchment-toned backgrounds** with subtle tonal variation — aged, warm, glowing, never flat sterile white. The ground is alive
- **Bold flat architectural color planes** with dramatic geometric cast shadows — a teal rectangle casting a black parallelogram shadow, creating spatial depth from pure flat shape
- **Faces and figures built from overlapping geometric shapes** — triangular noses, circular eyes with concentric rings, arrow-shaped hair, the human form as abstract geometric composition
- **Interlocking quarter-circles and semicircles** creating mosaic-like tile compositions — modular forms that tessellate in satisfying color rhythms
- **Fine precise parallel lines in groups of 2-3** running at angles across forms, like ruled pencil construction lines left visible as texture
- **Small geometric accents scattered rhythmically** — tiny triangles, dots, semicircles placed at intersections and along edges like punctuation marks in the composition
- **NO photographic textures, NO realistic rendering, NO gradients to simulate 3D** — everything is flat painted planes, circles, and lines on a warm ground

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Large dominant circle at top with radiating halo, smaller forms cascading below along sweeping diagonal lines, size = importance | Kandinsky's Composition VIII — the large black circle with pink halo commanding the upper-left |
| Flow/process | Sweeping diagonal thrust from lower-left to upper-right, geometric forms tumbling along the movement axis, arcs marking transitions between stages | Lissitzky's dynamic diagonal — revolutionary energy carrying forms forward |
| Connections | Fine thin lines connecting circles of different colors, creating a constellation-like web of relationships across the cream canvas | Kandinsky's precise line networks linking floating geometric nodes |
| Cycles | Concentric circles within a containing circle, overlapping colored arcs rotating around a center point — contained yet dynamic rotational energy | Kandinsky's Several Circles — planets in orbit |
| Comparison | Bold vertical division with contrasting color temperatures — warm saturated left half vs. cool deep right half, mirrored geometric forms on each side | Yellow-Red-Blue's triptych structure — warm chaos vs. cool order |
| Categories | Distinct geometric forms (circle, triangle, square) each in their own saturated color, arranged as overlapping mosaic tiles — form = category identity | Bauhaus color-form theory: yellow triangle, red square, blue circle |
| Growth | Expanding concentric rings with increasingly saturated halos, progressing small-to-large along a diagonal | Circles growing outward with luminous colored auras, each bigger ring bolder |
| Networks | Grid of intersecting diagonal lines with colored circles at crossing points, each node glowing with its own halo | Composition VIII's field of geometric nodes connected by taut precise lines |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Bauhaus Metaphor |
|------------------|------------------|
| Data/information | Circles of proportional size with colored halos indicating category — bigger circle = more significance |
| Processes | Sweeping diagonal line carrying geometric forms from one state to another, left-to-right momentum |
| Systems | Interlocking mosaic of quarter-circles and geometric tiles — each part fitting with its neighbors |
| Connections | Thin precise lines linking circles in constellation patterns against the cream ground |
| Growth | Concentric expanding rings with increasingly luminous halos — outward radiation of energy |
| Time | Diagonal sweep from lower-left (past) to upper-right (future) — the Constructivist arrow of progress |
| Hierarchy | Dominant large circle with halo at the visual peak, descending sizes below — gravity of importance |
| Protection | Enclosing circle containing a composition within it (Circles in a Circle) — the boundary as shelter |
| Speed | Sharp diagonal lines, arrow-triangles, dynamic angular thrust cutting across the composition |
| Stability | Large dense black circle anchoring the lower portion, horizontal architectural planes grounding the base |
| Users/people | Faces and figures built from bold overlapping geometric shapes — eyes as concentric circles, features as triangles and arcs |
| Ideas | Radiating yellow triangle with luminous golden glow — the brightest, sharpest, most energetic form |
| Energy | Overlapping red and orange planes, explosive diagonal lines crossing and clashing, arcs under tension |
| Tension/conflict | Curves fighting against straight lines, warm colors clashing with cool, a red wedge penetrating a blue plane |

## Typography

- Bold geometric sans-serif with architectural weight — Futura, Universal (Bayer), DIN — the typefaces designed at or inspired by Bauhaus itself
- Lowercase preference — Herbert Bayer's universal alphabet eliminated capitals as unnecessary decoration. Clean, modern, confident
- Type placed as a bold compositional element — large titles integrated directly into the geometric field, not floating above it
- Text on dramatic diagonal angles following the composition's energy — 15 to 45 degrees, not timid 5-degree tilts
- Key words highlighted in saturated primary color against black or cream — a red word punching through a black panel
- Lettering overlapping with geometric forms, partially occluded behind circles or planes for artistic depth and spatial tension
- NO decorative faces, NO serif fonts, NO ornamental anything — pure geometric letterforms only
- Letter-spacing generous in labels, tight in headlines — breathing room is a design decision

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT Memphis Design** — Memphis is deliberately anarchic, clashing, irreverent "bad taste" with terrazzo, squiggles, and zigzags. Bauhaus is systematic, philosophical, and purposeful. Every shape in Bauhaus has theoretical meaning (circle = cosmic, triangle = aggressive, square = stable). Memphis shapes clash for fun. If it looks like a party, it is Memphis, not Bauhaus.
- **NOT corporate flat illustration** — modern tech illustration uses muted tones, blobby figures, and squishy organic shapes. Bauhaus uses precise geometric forms, saturated pigment, and warm textured grounds. If it looks like a Slack loading screen, it is wrong.
- **NOT Art Deco** — Art Deco is symmetrical luxury: gold, chrome, opulent materials, Chrysler Building glamour. Bauhaus is democratic functionalism: primary colors, plywood, flat planes, Dessau workshop honesty. If it looks expensive and decorative, it is Deco, not Bauhaus.
- **NOT De Stijl / Mondrian** — De Stijl restricts itself to primary colors + black + white in a strict orthogonal grid. Bauhaus uses the full extended palette (purples, pinks, teals, oranges), diagonal compositions, curves, circles, and overlapping transparent planes. If it is only right angles and primary colors in a grid, it is Mondrian.
- **NOT minimalist modern design** — Bauhaus compositions are DENSE with overlapping forms, crossing lines, and layered shapes. A few clean circles on white is not Bauhaus — it is modern minimalism. The cream ground should be alive with geometric activity.
- **NOT pop art** — no halftone dots, no comic-book imagery, no commercial irony. Bauhaus is sincere abstract art with philosophical underpinning, not Lichtenstein's winking commentary.
- **NOT clinical or cold** — the warm cream ground, the luminous colored halos, the musical compositions — Bauhaus at its best is expressive and warm. If it looks like a sterile corporate diagram that happens to use geometric shapes, it has lost the soul.
- This must look like a Kandinsky painting on a gallery wall or a Herbert Bayer exhibition poster — bold, geometric, deeply saturated, compositionally dynamic, on a warm living ground — not a modern UI component library with circles and triangles.

## Best For

Expressive visual storytelling, dramatic comparisons, architectural and spatial concepts, abstract relationship mapping, educational concepts involving classification and categories, brand identity and creative industry topics, any content that benefits from bold artistic energy and dynamic geometric composition over sterile corporate diagramming.
