Flat muted colors, deadpan expressions, and uncomfortable suburban stillness. Figures stand isolated in parking lots and diners, rendered in clean precise lines with limited palettes of olive, mustard, and faded pink. The visual language of existential ennui and quiet alienation.

- Empty parking lots with a single car, single lamppost
- Diners with formica counters, vinyl booths, fluorescent lighting

- Interior scenes with sparse furniture, bare walls, single objects
- Thrift store clothing: cardigans, cat-eye glasses, vintage dresses

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Daniel Clowes Metaphor |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Data/information | Stacked boxes, filing cabinets, cluttered desks |
| Processes | Walking figure between locations, sequential panels |
| Systems | Suburban grid, strip mall layout, parking lot rows |
| Connections | Two figures sharing a diner booth, phone cord |
| Growth | Same character across panels aging subtly |
| Time | Clock on wall, changing light through window, seasons |
| Hierarchy | Boss behind desk, employee standing, office layout |
| Waiting | Figure on bench, at bus stop, in waiting room |
| Speed | Blur lines minimal—everything feels slow and stuck |
| Stability | Brick building, concrete, institutional architecture |
| Users/people | Specific character types: bored teen, sad adult, weirdo |
| Ideas | Thought bubble with simple object, speech balloon |
| Anxiety | Sweat drops, wide eyes, hunched shoulders |
| Boredom | Chin in hand, staring at nothing, slumped posture |
| Memory | Sepia-tinted panel, softer edges, different palette |

## Typography

- Clean sans-serif for labels, hand-lettered style for speech
- ALL CAPS in speech bubbles, mixed case for narration
- Modest sizing—never shouting, never decorative
- Black text on white balloons with simple black outline
- Caption boxes: white or pale color with thin border
- NO fancy display fonts. NO fun typefaces. NO playful styling.

## Anti-Patterns

**NOT bright or cheerful**: No saturated primaries. No happy colors. Everything is faded, olive, mustard, institutional. If it looks like a children's book, it's wrong.

**NOT manga or anime**: No big sparkly eyes, no speed lines, no exaggerated expressions. Emotions are subtle, suppressed, uncomfortable.

**NOT superhero comics**: No dynamic action poses, no rippling muscles, no capes. Figures are ordinary, slouchy, unglamorous.

**NOT gradient or rendered**: Absolutely NO gradients, NO airbrushing, NO smooth shading. Colors are FLAT blocks. Shadows are flat shapes.

**NOT decorative**: No ornate borders, no pattern fills, no decorative flourishes. Stark, plain, functional.

**NOT crowded**: Compositions feel empty. Lots of negative space. One or two figures maximum. A single object in a room.

**NOT nostalgic-cute**: While retro, this is NOT "cute vintage aesthetic." It's uncomfortable nostalgia. Alienation, not warmth.

**NOT expressive linework**: Lines are precise, controlled, mechanical. No sketchy energy, no brushy variation.
