# synthwave

Glowing neon grids stretching to an infinite horizon beneath a massive chrome sun bleeding hot pink and electric cyan into a deep violet sky — the digital dreamscape of 1980s retrofuturism. This is the VHS tracking-line shimmer, the laser disc menu screen, the Tron lightcycle trail, the Miami Vice sunset rendered in pure luminous color on black velvet. Palm tree silhouettes cut against gradient skies, chrome text catches impossibly bright highlights, and everything pulses with the warm electronic hum of analog synthesizers made visual.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Hot magenta/pink (#FF00FF / #FF2D95), electric cyan (#00FFFF / #00E5FF), deep violet (#2D0052)
- Background: Near-black with purple undertone (#0D001A), deep navy-violet (#1A0033), or rich midnight blue (#0A0A2E) — never pure #000000, always warm-shifted toward purple
- Accents: Laser orange (#FF6B00), chrome yellow (#FFD700), molten red (#FF1744), electric blue (#2979FF), plasma green (#00E676)
- Gradients: Hot pink to electric cyan horizontal sunsets, violet to black vertical fades, chrome silver to warm gold metallic sheens
- Text: Bright white with subtle glow (#FFFFFF with bloom), chrome silver (#C0C0C0) with highlight streaks, or neon-colored text matching accent palette — never muted or dark text

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Classic Sunset | Hot pink + electric cyan + deep violet + chrome yellow sun — the canonical synthwave sunset with perspective grid |
| Miami Night | Magenta + teal + deep navy + laser orange accents — neon signs reflecting on wet asphalt |
| Tron Circuit | Electric cyan + deep black-blue + white glow lines + magenta accents — digital wireframe world |
| Chrome Dreams | Silver metallic + gold highlights + violet shadows + hot pink reflections — gleaming retro-futuristic surfaces |
| Outrun | Hot pink + orange gradient sun + purple sky + cyan grid lines — the driving game aesthetic, pure speed |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Sunset Grid** | Perspective grid disappearing into glowing horizon with massive sun | Receding grid lines in cyan/magenta on dark ground, enormous circle sun with horizontal stripe-through lines, gradient sky from hot pink at horizon to deep violet at top, palm tree silhouettes at edges |
| **Neon City** | Glowing urban silhouettes, signs, and reflections on wet streets | Building outlines traced in neon cyan and magenta, glowing signage, rain-slick streets reflecting colors, fog/mist diffusing light, vertical composition of towering structures |
| **Chrome** | Gleaming metallic surfaces with impossibly vivid reflections | Mirror-finish lettering and objects, hot-pink-to-cyan gradient reflections on chrome, lens flares, smooth polished surfaces catching neon light |
| **Wireframe** | Pure geometric line art glowing on black, Tron-style digital space | Objects rendered as glowing cyan wireframe meshes on pure black, vertices marked with bright dots, geometric precision with electronic glow, no fills — only luminous edges |

## Visual Elements

- **Perspective grid floor**: Receding parallel lines and cross-lines creating a flat ground plane that stretches to the horizon, drawn in glowing cyan or magenta on dark background — the single most defining synthwave element
- **Massive gradient sun/circle**: Large circle sitting at or just above the horizon line, filled with horizontal pink-to-orange gradient bands, often sliced by horizontal black lines creating a venetian-blind effect — NOT a realistic sun, a graphic icon
- **Palm tree silhouettes**: Black palm trees with fronds sharply defined against glowing sky gradients — always silhouettes, never detailed, placed at composition edges as framing devices
- **Neon glow and bloom**: All bright elements bleed light outward — soft luminous halos surrounding bright lines and shapes, creating a warm electronic glow effect like actual neon tubes or CRT phosphor bloom
- **Chrome and metallic surfaces**: Mirror-reflective text and objects showing hot-pink-to-cyan gradient reflections, sharp white highlight streaks, the impossibly polished surfaces of 80s airbrushed art
- **Horizontal scan lines**: Faint parallel horizontal lines running across the entire composition, like a CRT monitor or VHS tape — subtle texture that reads as "electronic display"
- **Glowing wireframe objects**: 3D geometric forms (pyramids, spheres, cubes, cars, buildings) rendered as luminous edge-only wireframes on dark backgrounds
- **Gradient sky**: Vertical color gradient from hot pink/orange at horizon through magenta and violet to near-black at top — the synthwave sky is ALWAYS a gradient, never flat
- **Star field dots**: Tiny white dots scattered across the upper dark portions of the sky, like stars seen through the atmosphere of a neon-lit planet
- **Laser beam lines**: Thin bright lines shooting diagonally or horizontally across the composition in pure neon colors, like laser light show beams cutting through fog
- **NO daylight scenes, NO natural lighting, NO earth tones, NO muted colors** — everything is artificial, electronic, luminous, and saturated
- **NO flat matte surfaces** — everything either glows, reflects, or exists in deep shadow

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Vertical stack against neon city skyline — tallest/most important building glows brightest, descending importance as shorter structures fade into background haze | Blade Runner cityscape layered depth |
| Flow/process | Perspective grid floor with glowing nodes along a path receding to horizon — each step a neon marker getting smaller as it approaches the vanishing point | Outrun racing game road stretching to infinity |
| Connections | Glowing wireframe network — nodes as bright spheres connected by luminous cyan lines floating in dark 3D space | Tron's digital landscape of connected programs |
| Cycles | Rotating neon ring or orbital path with glowing markers at intervals, seen in perspective against dark sky | Spinning record or CD rendered as neon halo |
| Comparison | Split composition at horizon line — two different neon-colored sections meeting at the center sun, mirror reflections below the grid | Dual sunset reflected in chrome |
| Categories | Separate neon-outlined panels or screens floating in dark space, each glowing a different accent color, like multiple monitors in a dark room | Multi-monitor setup in a dark control room |
| Growth | Ascending bars or columns rendered as glowing wireframes, each taller and brighter than the last, building toward a crescendo | Audio equalizer bars pulsing upward |
| Timeline | Horizontal path along the perspective grid from left to right, markers as glowing vertical pillars at each date, receding to vanishing point | Highway stretching to neon horizon |
| Overview | Bird's-eye view of a glowing grid city, buildings as illuminated wireframe blocks, major elements marked with brighter neon colors | Aerial Tron cityscape |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Synthwave Metaphor |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Data/information | Glowing geometric shapes floating in dark space, sized proportionally, pulsing with neon light |

| Innovation | Chrome object emerging from the grid, reflections catching impossible colors, the new thing gleaming |
| Danger | Red-shifted palette, warning-stripe neon patterns, flickering/glitching glow effects |

## Typography

- Bold geometric sans-serif with wide proportions — Futura, Eurostile, Microgramma, or similar futuristic faces
- Chrome effect lettering: letters rendered as if made of polished metal, with hot-pink-to-cyan gradient reflections and sharp white highlight streaks along edges
- Neon glow text: letterforms surrounded by soft luminous bloom in matching neon color, reading as glowing tube signage
- ALL CAPS for primary headlines — synthwave typography is confident, bold, and declarative
- Generous letter-spacing (tracking) for a wide cinematic feel — letters breathe, never cramped
- Text often placed against the darkest part of the composition (upper sky) for maximum contrast
- Italic or slanted variants suggest speed and forward motion
- Outline-only text with neon glow for secondary elements — wire letters with luminous edges
- NO serif fonts, NO handwritten/script faces, NO rounded/friendly faces — everything is hard-edged, futuristic, and mechanical

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT cyberpunk-neon**: Cyberpunk is gritty, dirty, rain-soaked, and dystopian with cluttered Japanese signage and grimy textures. Synthwave is CLEAN, sleek, and optimistically nostalgic — polished chrome, smooth gradients, geometric purity. No grime, no clutter, no decay.
- **NOT vaporwave**: Vaporwave uses pastel pinks, Roman busts, Windows 95 icons, and ironic corporate aesthetics. Synthwave is SATURATED, not pastel. Hot neon, not soft millennial pink. Earnest retro-futurism, not ironic nostalgia.
- **NOT actual 1980s design**: Real 80s design was often busy, cluttered, and gaudy. Synthwave is an idealized, romanticized version — cleaner, more geometric, more cinematic than the actual decade.
- **NOT Googie or atomic-age**: Those are 1950s aesthetics with cream backgrounds, organic boomerang shapes, and warm illustration. Synthwave is 1980s, digital, dark-backgrounded, and neon-lit. Three decades apart in mood and method.
- **NOT a dark mode UI**: The dark background must be rich violet-black, not neutral gray or true black. Elements glow and bloom, they don't just sit on a dark surface. There must be atmosphere and depth, not flat darkness.
- **NOT just "neon colors on black"**: Without the perspective grid, the gradient sun, the chrome surfaces, and the atmospheric glow, neon-on-black is just generic. The specific visual vocabulary (grid floor, sliced sun, palm silhouettes, scan lines) is what MAKES it synthwave.
- This must look like an 80s sci-fi movie poster or a retrowave album cover, not a generic dark-mode tech diagram with colored lines.
