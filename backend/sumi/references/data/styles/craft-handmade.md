# craft-handmade

The aesthetic of things made by human hands with care — paper cutting, felt appliqué, sewn textiles, collaged scraps, washi tape, rubber stamps, hand-stitched edges. This is the visual language of Etsy shops, craft blogs, scrapbooking, and makers who find beauty in imperfection. Textures you want to touch: linen weave, kraft paper grain, the raised edge of a die-cut shape. Slightly crooked lines that prove a person made this, not a machine. Thread, button, fabric, paper, wood — materials with warmth and history, assembled with love.

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT digital or vector** — everything must look physically made, not computer-generated
- **NOT perfect or precise** — the charm is in handmade irregularity, human imperfection
- **NOT slick or corporate** — warm, personal, maker aesthetic, not professional design
- **NOT minimal** — craft is layered, textured, embellished. Minimalism is not the goal.
- **NOT photography** — stylized interpretation, not photographic documentation
- **NOT mass-produced aesthetic** — handmade means unique, not manufactured uniformity
- **NOT childish** — crafted with skill and intention, not amateur or messy
- This must look like something a skilled maker created by hand — layered, textured, touchable, warm, with the beautiful imperfections that prove human care went into every element.
