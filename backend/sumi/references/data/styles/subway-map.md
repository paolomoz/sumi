# subway-map

Harry Beck's revolutionary 1931 London Underground diagram — the realization that a transit map doesn't need geographic accuracy, only topological truth. Lines run at 0°, 45°, or 90° angles. Stations are evenly spaced. Rivers become stylized blue curves. The chaos of actual geography transformed into the clean logic of connection. Color-coded lines intersecting at nodes, the visual grammar of how to get from here to there. Every major city's transit system now speaks this visual language: NYC's rainbow spaghetti, Tokyo's intricate web, Paris's art nouveau stations. This is the diagram as interface, the map as user experience.

## Color Palette

- Lines: Bold transit colors — red (#FF0000), blue (#0000FF), green (#008000), yellow (#FFD700), orange (#FF8C00), purple (#800080), brown (#8B4513), pink (#FF69B4)
- Background: Off-white (#F5F5F5), pale gray (#E0E0E0), or system-specific cream
- Water: Stylized pale blue (#ADD8E6) or teal (#008B8B)
- Stations: White circles (#FFFFFF) with black or colored outlines
- Interchange: Larger white circles or doubled circles, connection nodes
- Text: Black (#000000) or dark gray (#333333), sometimes matching line color

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| London Underground | The original palette — red, blue, green, yellow, black, brown + cream background |
| NYC Subway | Rainbow palette — every color represented, white background |
| Minimal | Black lines only + single accent color — reduced schematic |
| Modern | Cool palette — teals, blues, grays — contemporary transit |
| Heritage | Warm palette — cream background, brown and maroon lines — vintage transit |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Classic** | Traditional transit diagram, Beck-style geometry | 45° angles, even spacing, schematic purity |
| **Network** | Complex interconnected system, many lines | Full web of routes, interchange complexity |
| **Route** | Single journey highlighted, wayfinding | One path emphasized through larger system |
| **Abstract** | Transit diagram applied to non-transit concepts | The visual language adapted for other connections |
| **Illustrated** | Transit style with pictorial station icons | Landmarks at stations, slightly more figurative |

## Visual Elements

- **Color-coded lines** — each route a distinct color, color as identity and wayfinding
- **45° and 90° angles only** — the fundamental Beck rule, no other angles permitted
- **Station nodes** — circles or ticks marking stops, sized by importance
- **Interchange circles** — larger white circles where lines meet, connection points
- **Even station spacing** — geographic distance ignored for topological clarity
- **Line thickness consistency** — all routes equal weight (except emphasis)
- **Terminal stations** — bars or larger nodes at end points
- **Stylized water** — rivers reduced to simple blue curves
- **Zone boundaries** — dashed lines or shading showing fare zones
- **Under construction** — dashed lines for future routes
- **Directional labels** — terminus names at line ends
- **Legend** — line names with color keys

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Network | Full system map, all connections visible | Complete transit diagram |
| Journey | Single route highlighted through network | Wayfinding, trip planning |
| Hub | Central interchange with radiating lines | Main station focus |
| Comparison | Parallel lines, similar routes side by side | Route options |
| Historical | Evolution of network over time, growth phases | System development |
| Zones | Geographic or categorical regions | Zone map, area divisions |
| Hierarchical | Express vs. local, main vs. branch lines | Line weight differentiation |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Subway Map Metaphor |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Data/information | Stations as data points, line paths as relationships |
| Processes | Journey from origin to destination, sequential stations |
| Systems | The network itself — interconnected routes, exchanges |
| Connections | Interchange stations, places where paths meet |
| Pathways | Color-coded lines, routes through the system |
| Options | Multiple lines serving similar areas, route choices |
| Hierarchy | Express vs. local, major vs. minor interchanges |
| Complexity | Network density, number of interchanges |
| Growth | Dashed lines for expansion, historical overlay |
| Navigation | The map as wayfinding tool, how to get from A to B |
| Users/people | Implied passengers, the human journey through system |
| Time | Estimated journey time, rush hour vs. off-peak |
| Bottlenecks | Crowded interchanges, required transfers |

## Typography

- **Johnston/Gill Sans style** — the classic British transit typeface, geometric humanist
- **Helvetica** — the Swiss alternative, used worldwide
- **Horizontal text preferred** — station names readable, consistent orientation
- **Angled only when necessary** — 45° text along diagonal lines
- **Hierarchy through size** — major stations larger text, minor stations smaller
- **All caps for station names** — traditional transit convention
- **Line names at termini** — direction indicated at line ends
- **Legibility paramount** — transit type must be readable quickly

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT geographically accurate** — the whole point is topological abstraction
- **NOT curved lines** — only 45° and 90° angles, no organic curves (except stylized water)
- **NOT decorative** — pure information design, no ornamentation
- **NOT illustrated** — schematic abstraction, not pictorial representation
- **NOT perspective** — flat diagrammatic view, no 3D
- **NOT complex angles** — the discipline of limited angles is fundamental
- **NOT photographic** — the map replaces photography entirely
- **NOT cluttered** — information hierarchy, not everything equal
- This must look like an actual transit diagram — Harry Beck's London Underground, NYC's subway map, Tokyo Metro — clean lines at strict angles, color-coded routes, schematic clarity.

## Best For

Process flows, system architecture, network visualization, journey mapping, step-by-step guides, organizational structures, decision trees, route planning, anything showing connections and pathways through a system, technology infrastructure.
