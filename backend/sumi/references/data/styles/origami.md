# origami

Crisp geometric forms folded from single sheets of paper — sharp mountain folds catching light along clean edges, valley folds creating deep angular shadows, every surface a flat faceted plane of subtly different tone where the paper catches or blocks the light. A crane mid-unfold revealing its triangular skeleton, a modular kusudama sphere built from interlocking folded units, a landscape of angular paper mountains rising from a creased horizon. This is Akira Yoshizawa's wet-folded organic curves meeting Robert Lang's mathematical tessellations, the magic of a flat sheet becoming three-dimensional through nothing but precise geometry. Clean, structural, meditative.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Crisp white paper (#FFFFFF) with shadow tones (#E8E8E8, #D0D0D0, #B8B8B8) — the same white sheet rendered in 4+ values by fold angle and light direction
- Background: Soft warm gray (#E0DCD8), pale sky blue (#D6E8F0), or matte charcoal (#3A3A3A) — clean surfaces that let the paper forms breathe
- Traditional washi: Deep vermillion red (#CC3333), indigo blue (#2C4A7C), forest green (#2D6A4F), imperial purple (#5B2C6F), mustard gold (#C8A62C) — saturated solid colors of Japanese craft paper
- Metallic accents: Gold foil (#D4A843), silver (#A8A8B0), copper (#B87333) — used sparingly for special emphasis, catching light on fold edges
- Gradient on folds: Each face of a folded form is a slightly different value of the same hue — lighter where it faces the light source, darker in shadow — creating the essential faceted-paper look
- Text: Clean dark gray (#333333) or white, always outside the paper forms, never printed on them

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| White-on-White | Pure white paper forms on soft gray background — all depth comes from fold shadows and light angles, maximum elegance, minimum color |
| Washi Traditional | Vermillion red + indigo blue + gold foil accent on charcoal background — bold Japanese craft paper colors, each form a single solid color |
| Pastel Fold | Soft pink (#E8B4B8) + pale blue (#B4C8E0) + mint green (#B8D8C8) + cream (#F0E8D8) — gentle origami paper colors, each folded unit a different pastel |
| Monochrome Study | Single color in 5+ values from near-white to deep — forest green from #E0F0E0 to #1A4A2F — all tonal variation from fold geometry |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Classic** | Traditional origami models — crane, boat, frog, box | Recognizable folded forms with clean creases, rendered in white or traditional washi colors, each model shown at a slight angle to reveal its faceted 3D structure. Crisp mountain/valley fold lines visible on surfaces |
| **Tessellation** | Mathematical fold patterns, tiled geometric surfaces | Flat sheets with complex repeating fold patterns creating 3D texture — hexagonal twists, Miura-ori chevrons, waterbomb tessellations. The sheet stays flat but the surface undulates with geometric precision |
| **Modular** | Kusudama spheres, Sonobe units, interlocking assembled forms | Multiple identical folded units interlocking to create larger geometric structures — stellated polyhedra, spiked spheres, interlocking cubes. Each unit a different color, the whole greater than the sum |
| **Wet-Fold** | Organic curved forms, Yoshizawa-inspired soft shapes | Paper that curves and flows rather than creasing sharply — rounded animal bodies, petal-like curves, organic forms that look sculpted rather than folded. Softer shadows, fewer hard edges, more naturalistic |

## Visual Elements

- **Faceted planar surfaces** — every surface is a flat geometric plane meeting other planes at crisp fold angles. Light hits each facet differently, creating a mosaic of values from a single-color sheet. This faceted quality is THE defining origami visual trait
- **Sharp crease lines** — visible mountain and valley fold lines running across paper surfaces as thin precise ridges and valleys, catching highlights along their peaks and casting thin shadow lines in their valleys
- **Angular geometric shadows** — shadows that follow the geometry of the folds, not soft organic gradients. A triangular flap casts a triangular shadow. Shadow edges are as crisp as the paper edges
- **Paper edge thickness** — the actual thickness of the paper visible where sheets fold over, revealing a thin line of paper cross-section. This tiny detail sells the illusion that these are real folded sheets
- **Subtle paper texture** — very fine fiber grain visible on surfaces, especially in lighter areas. Not heavy texture — just enough to read as real paper rather than smooth plastic
- **Single-sheet integrity** — every form visibly made from a single continuous sheet. No cuts, no glue joints, no separate pieces (unless modular variant). The viewer should be able to mentally unfold any form back to a flat square
- **Triangulated geometry** — most origami resolves into triangles. The visual vocabulary is dominated by triangular facets, diamond shapes, and angular intersections rather than curves or circles
- **Clean negative space** — paper forms placed against uncluttered backgrounds with generous breathing room. The complexity is in the fold geometry, not in the surroundings
- **Soft directional lighting** — single light source from upper-left casting consistent shadows across all forms, making the 3D fold structure readable through value changes on each facet
- **Fold-line diagrams as decoration** — dotted and dashed fold lines (mountain = dash-dot, valley = dash-dash) used as subtle decorative elements in backgrounds or borders, referencing origami instruction diagrams
- **NO rounded edges, NO soft blurs, NO organic curves** (except wet-fold variant) — paper folds are crisp, geometric, and angular
- **NO printed patterns on paper surfaces** — color comes from the paper itself, not from printing on it. Each sheet is a solid color or white
- **NO scissors, NO glue, NO tape visible** — origami is folding only. The purity of the constraint defines the aesthetic

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Largest origami form at center, smaller supporting forms arranged around it by decreasing size — a large crane flanked by smaller birds, scale indicating importance | Central crane towering over a flock of smaller folded forms |
| Flow/process | Sequence of progressive folds — flat square on the left, partially folded forms in the middle, completed model on the right, showing the transformation from sheet to sculpture | Origami instruction strip: square -> base -> intermediate -> finished crane |
| Connections | Modular units interlocking — separate folded pieces joining together to form a larger structure, each unit a different color, connections at fold-lock points | Kusudama sphere assembly — individual units clicking into a unified whole |
| Cycles | Circular arrangement of folded forms, each a slight variation or rotation of the previous, creating a pinwheel or mandala pattern | Ring of cranes nose-to-tail forming a circular wreath |
| Comparison | Two origami models side by side on the same background — same paper color, different folds, showing how the same sheet becomes different forms | Crane vs. frog from identical squares — same starting point, different results |
| Categories | Groups of related models on separate background panels — animals in one group, flowers in another, geometric forms in a third, each group on its own colored surface | Origami taxonomy: fauna, flora, geometric, modular |
| Growth | Ascending sequence of increasingly complex folds — simple boat, intermediate flower, complex dragon — each step more facets and more triangulated surfaces | Progression from 4-fold boat to 200-fold dragon |
| Networks | Central hub model connected to satellite models by thin fold-line diagram lines (dashed), showing relationships between forms that share the same base fold | Base-fold family tree: bird base spawning crane, flapping bird, and phoenix |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Origami Metaphor |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Data/information | Number of facets and fold complexity — more folds = more data, simpler forms = simpler data |
| Processes | Progressive folding sequence — flat sheet transforming step by step into finished form, each fold a process stage |
| Systems | Modular origami — individual units interlocking into a larger functioning structure, each unit simple but the assembly complex |
| Connections | Interlocking fold tabs — units connecting at geometric joints, physical paper-lock connections |
| Growth | Increasing fold complexity from simple to elaborate, forms becoming more detailed and three-dimensional |
| Time | Left-to-right unfolding sequence — crumpled/flat past to fully-formed present to unfolding future |
| Hierarchy | Scale — largest and most complex form dominates, smaller simpler forms are subordinate |
| Protection | Box or container fold — a geometric enclosure protecting contents, paper walls folded up around a central space |
| Speed | Paper airplane form — angular, aerodynamic, dart-shaped, folded for flight |
| Stability | Flat-bottomed box or boat form — wide base, low center of gravity, stable geometric foundation |
| Users/people | Anthropomorphic folded figures — simplified human shapes created from paper, each with a distinctive silhouette |
| Ideas | Unfolding action — a form mid-unfold, revealing hidden interior surfaces, the moment of opening and discovery |
| Energy | Spiked modular forms — stellated polyhedra with points radiating outward in all directions, energetic and dynamic |
| Tension/conflict | Crumpled vs. crisp — a crumpled paper ball contrasted with a perfectly folded form, disorder meeting order |

## Typography

- Clean geometric sans-serif — light to regular weight, never heavy. The typography should feel as precise and clean as the fold geometry
- Thin letterforms echoing the crispness of paper edges — DIN, Gotham Thin, or Avenir Light
- Text placed outside paper forms on the clean background surface — never on the paper objects themselves
- Minimal labels — short, precise, lowercase or small-caps, widely letter-spaced
- White or light gray text on dark backgrounds; dark gray on light backgrounds — always quiet and subordinate to the paper forms
- Numbers can be rendered as small folded paper digits for decorative emphasis — but only for key numbers, not body text
- Fold-line diagram notation (dashes and dots) can appear as subtle decorative text dividers
- NO bold heavy type, NO decorative fonts, NO handwriting — typography is as disciplined and clean as the folding itself
- Text alignment follows the same angular geometry as the compositions — aligned to edges of paper forms or to the grid

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT low-poly 3D art** — Low-poly uses triangulated meshes on organic forms (low-poly animals, mountains). Origami shows physically foldable geometry from a single flat sheet. Low-poly is a rendering technique; origami is a physical constraint. If the form could not be folded from paper, it is wrong.
- **NOT papercraft/paper cutout style** — Papercraft uses cut, scored, and glued flat pieces assembled into 3D forms. Origami uses ONLY folds, no cuts, no glue. If there are visible cut edges, tabs, or glue flaps, it is papercraft not origami.
- **NOT geometric abstract art** — Abstract geometric art (Bauhaus, constructivism) uses triangles and planes as pure visual elements. Origami geometry comes specifically from the physics of folding a flat sheet — every angle and plane must be physically plausible as a fold.
- **NOT kirigami** — Kirigami allows cutting the paper. Origami does not. Snowflake patterns, pop-up cards, and cut-fold hybrids are kirigami, not origami.
- **NOT crumpled paper texture** — Crumpled paper is random, organic, chaotic. Origami folds are precise, deliberate, geometric. A wadded-up paper ball is the opposite of origami.
- **NOT flat illustration with fold lines drawn on** — The forms must read as genuinely three-dimensional folded objects with real shadows and faceted lighting, not flat 2D drawings with dashed lines suggesting folds.
- **NOT isometric technical** — Though both are geometric, isometric technical is about engineering precision with callout lines and specifications. Origami is about the poetry of a single sheet transformed through folding.
- This must look like real paper folded by human hands and photographed under soft directional light — crisp creases, faceted shadows, visible paper thickness at edges, authentic material presence. Not a digital geometric exercise that happens to use triangles.

## Best For
