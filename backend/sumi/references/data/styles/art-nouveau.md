# art-nouveau

Sinuous whiplash curves flowing like living vines across every surface — the organic exuberance of Art Nouveau (1890-1910) where nature becomes ornament and ornament becomes structure. Peacock feathers unfurling in iridescent arcs, dragonfly wings rendered in stained-glass jewel tones, intertwining tendrils crawling up the borders and bursting into stylized lily blooms at the corners. Iron and glass transformed into organic forms, every straight line banished in favor of undulating botanical rhythms. This is Hector Guimard's Paris Metro entrances, Victor Horta's staircase ironwork, Emile Galle's glass vases — nature abstracted into pure decorative line.

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Guimard** | Structural ironwork curves, architectural organic forms | Bold sinuous iron-like curves forming structural frames and borders, thick confident whiplash lines that feel like they could support weight, green patinated metal aesthetic, Paris Metro entrance organic architecture |
| **Klimt** | Gold leaf patterns filling organic shapes, decorative mosaic | Organic silhouettes filled with dense geometric mosaic patterns — spirals, circles, triangles, eyes — inside flowing organic outlines. Gold leaf as dominant ground, Byzantine richness within Art Nouveau form |
| **Tiffany** | Stained glass luminosity, nature rendered in jewel tones | Compositions that glow as if backlit — rich saturated jewel colors (teal, amber, deep rose) separated by dark leading lines, nature scenes (wisteria, water lilies, dragonflies) rendered as leaded glass panels |
| **Morris** | Dense allover botanical patterns, wallpaper-like repetition | Interlocking floral and foliar patterns covering every surface — acanthus leaves, tulips, honeysuckle — in muted earth tones with rhythmic bilateral symmetry, dense but harmonious |
| **Horta** | Flowing interior ironwork, integrated ornament-as-structure | Thin elegant iron tendrils spreading across surfaces, curving lines that serve simultaneously as decoration and structural framework, exposed organic curves like growing vines in metal |

## Visual Elements

- Sinuous "whiplash" curves — the signature Art Nouveau line: long, flowing, S-shaped curves that move like growing vines or cracking whips, never straight, never angular, always alive with organic energy
- Stylized botanical forms — lilies, irises, orchids, lotus, wisteria, and poppies rendered as elegant flat decorative shapes with flowing outlines, NOT realistic botanical accuracy but nature abstracted into pure ornamental line
- Peacock feathers and peacock eye motifs — the quintessential Art Nouveau symbol: iridescent fan-shaped plumes with concentric eye patterns in teal, gold, and deep blue, used as borders, accents, and standalone decorative elements
- Dragonfly and butterfly wing forms — translucent wings rendered with stained-glass quality, veined with dark leading lines, filled with jewel-toned color, used as decorative accents and framing elements
- Intertwining vine and tendril borders — thick ornamental borders where plant stems wrap and weave around each other, bursting into stylized blooms at corners and intersections, the border as organic living frame
- Metallic accent lines in gold, copper, or bronze — thin gleaming lines tracing the edges of forms, suggesting wrought iron, jewelry, or gilded ornament
- Stained-glass color treatment — saturated jewel tones separated by dark outlines suggesting leading, with the sense that light glows through from behind
- Flowing hair as decorative abstraction — long curving lines that begin as hair but transform into vines, waves, or pure ornamental curves filling the composition
- Negative space as active organic shape — the spaces between elements are themselves flowing organic forms, not dead rectangles
- Mosaic and geometric pattern fills inside organic outlines — spirals, circles, triangles, and checkerboards contained within flowing shapes (Klimt influence)
- Asymmetric but rhythmically balanced compositions — nothing is perfectly symmetrical, but everything feels naturally balanced, like a plant growing toward light
- NO straight lines, NO sharp corners, NO geometric rigidity — every edge curves, every corner rounds, every structure undulates
- NO flat digital vector aesthetic — all surfaces suggest material warmth: glass, metal, printed paper, embossed leather

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Vertical growing tree or vine — trunk at base (foundation), branches spreading upward (sub-topics), flowers blooming at the tips (outcomes/results) | Klimt's Tree of Life — the organic hierarchy |
| Flow/process | Flowing ribbon or stream of water carrying elements from right to left (or curving through the composition), each stage a bloom or node on the flowing line | Mucha poster borders where flowing forms guide the eye through stages |
| Connections | Intertwining vine tendrils linking separate elements — stems reaching between groups, wrapping around nodes, creating organic bridges | Morris wallpaper patterns where every element connects through botanical structure |
| Cycles | Circular wreath of seasonal flowers — spring blooms at top, summer at right, autumn at bottom, winter at left, all connected by a continuous vine ring | Mucha's Seasons series arranged as a continuous circle |
| Comparison | Mirrored organic forms flanking a central axis — left and right compositions reflecting each other with botanical symmetry, a central ornamental divider | Architectural facade symmetry with organic ornamental details |
| Categories | Distinct flower species on a shared branching stem — each category a different bloom (lily, iris, orchid, rose) growing from the same organic structure | Botanical plate showing varieties on shared root system |
| Growth | Unfurling fern frond from tight spiral to open spread — progression from closed/small to open/large along a graceful curve | Tiffany glass fern and plant growth patterns |
| Networks | Root system or neural vine pattern — underground network of organic connections, nodes where roots intersect or bulbs cluster | Gaudi's organic structural systems, branching like nature |
| Radial | Flower head viewed from above — petals radiating from a central pistil, each petal containing content, the whole forming a complete bloom | Rose window translated into organic Art Nouveau forms |
| Layered | Foreground vine frames with middle-ground content and distant background visible through organic openings | Stained glass window with foreground flora framing a scene |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Art Nouveau Metaphor |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Data/information | Flowing water, scattered seeds, pollen drifting — organic particles representing discrete units of knowledge |
| Processes | Growing vine following a sinuous path — each node a stage, the vine itself the continuity between stages |
| Systems | Tree with root network below and canopy above — roots as hidden infrastructure, trunk as core, branches as subsystems, leaves as outputs |
| Connections | Intertwining tendrils reaching between elements — organic bridges linking separate botanical forms |
| Growth | Blooming flower sequence — closed bud to opening petals to full radiant bloom along a curved stem |
| Time | Seasonal progression — bare branches to spring buds to summer bloom to autumn leaves to winter skeletal beauty |
| Hierarchy | Branch structure — thick trunk (most important) branching into progressively thinner stems (less important) ending in delicate leaf tips |
| Protection | Thorny rose stems, protective bark, enclosing petals, shell forms — nature's own defense mechanisms |
| Speed | Swallows in flight, dragonflies darting, flowing water rushing over stones — natural movement and urgency |
| Stability | Ancient oak tree with deep spreading roots, moss-covered stone, established perennial garden — endurance through organic strength |
| Users/people | Stylized figures with flowing robes and cascading hair, integrated into ornamental composition, hair becoming vine, robe becoming leaf |
| Ideas | Radiant light burst through stained glass — a central glow illuminating surrounding organic forms |
| Energy | Sunburst pattern with organic radiating lines, flame motifs with sinuous curves, electrical-organic crackling tendrils |
| Categories | Different flower species, each with distinct form and color treatment, growing from shared soil |
| Transformation | Chrysalis to butterfly, bud to bloom, caterpillar to moth — metamorphosis rendered in ornamental flat style |

## Typography

- Elegant flowing letterforms with organic curves integrated into the character shapes — letter stems that swell and taper like plant stalks
- Gold or metallic title treatments with decorative flourishes extending from letter terminals into ornamental vine tendrils
- Text placed within decorative banner ribbons, ornamental cartouches, or flowing organic frames
- Ornamental drop capitals with vine and floral decoration filling the enlarged initial letter
- Serif faces with Art Nouveau character — slightly swelling strokes, organic terminations, never mechanical
- Text can follow curved baselines, flowing along sinuous paths rather than rigid horizontal lines
- Labels integrated organically into the composition, appearing to grow from the same visual system as the ornament
- NO stark modern sans-serif, NO monospace, NO digital-looking type — everything harmonizes with the organic ornamental program
- Color variation in text: titles in gold, body in forest green, emphasis in burgundy, all on warm ivory ground

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT Art Nouveau Mucha specifically** — Mucha is ONE artist within Art Nouveau. Generic Art Nouveau encompasses Guimard's ironwork, Klimt's gold mosaics, Tiffany's glass, Morris's textiles, Horta's architecture. Do NOT default to a central female figure with Byzantine halo — that is Mucha, not broad Art Nouveau
- **NOT Art Deco** — Art Deco replaced Art Nouveau with GEOMETRIC forms: zigzags, chevrons, sunburst rays, stepped pyramids. Art Nouveau is ORGANIC: curves, vines, flowers, no straight lines. If you see a zigzag or a sunburst, it is wrong
- **NOT realistic botanical illustration** — Art Nouveau STYLIZES nature into decorative flatness. A scientifically accurate flower drawing is botanical illustration, not Art Nouveau. The flower must be simplified into ornamental curves
- **NOT a modern organic brand identity** — modern "organic" designs use soft blobs and rounded rectangles. Art Nouveau uses SPECIFIC botanical and zoological forms (peacock feathers, dragonfly wings, lily stems) rendered in a SPECIFIC sinuous line language
- **NOT stained glass alone** — while Tiffany is Art Nouveau, the style is broader than stained glass. It includes metalwork, posters, furniture, textiles, architecture. Stained glass is one expression, not the definition
- **NOT Rinpa or Japanese decorative** — though Art Nouveau was influenced by Japanese art, the execution is completely different. Rinpa uses bold flat shapes on gold leaf. Art Nouveau uses sinuous intertwining lines on warm ivory. No gold leaf grounds, no tarashikomi pooling
- **NOT a clean modern infographic with curvy lines** — the ORNAMENTAL DENSITY is essential. Art Nouveau borders are thick, detailed, and labor-intensive. A simple diagram with a few wavy lines is not Art Nouveau
- This must look like a page from a lavish 1900 Parisian design magazine or an ornamental ironwork catalog — every surface alive with botanical ornament, every line flowing and organic — not a modern "nature-inspired" design with soft curves and green accents
