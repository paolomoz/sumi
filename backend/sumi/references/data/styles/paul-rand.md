Playful geometric wit distilled to its simplest form — a circle becomes an eye, a rectangle becomes a gift box, primary colors pop against white with the confidence of a perfect logo. This is the IBM stripes, the ABC circle, the NeXT cube, the Colorforms cleverness of a mind that found joy in reducing ideas to their most essential geometric form. Sophisticated simplicity with a wink.

## Color Palette

- Primary: True blue (#0033A0), signal red (#EE3124), sunshine yellow (#FFD100), jet black (#000000)
- Background: Clean white (#FFFFFF) — the default, keeps focus on shapes — or occasionally a primary color field
- Neutrals: Black (#000000) for outlines and text, warm gray (#9B9B9B) sparingly
- Accents: The primary colors ARE the accents — never more than 2-3 colors per composition, often just one color + black + white

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| IBM | Blue horizontal stripes on white, black type — the corporate classic, rhythm through repetition |
| ABC | Black circle with white lowercase letters, or yellow circle — simple, bold, iconic |
| Playful | Red + yellow + blue shapes on white — children's book energy, Colorforms joy |
| Restrained | Single primary color + black + white — maximum impact through minimal palette |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Logo** | Single iconic symbol, maximum reduction, instant recognition | One shape that captures an entire idea — a circle for unity, a square for stability, geometric elements combined to form a memorable mark |
| **Collage** | Cut-paper shapes arranged playfully, overlapping primary color forms | Loose, joyful arrangement of circles, squares, triangles in primary colors, like Colorforms on a white board, child-like but sophisticated |
| **Rebus** | Pictures replacing words, visual puns, wit through substitution | Eye + BEE + M = IBM. Shapes that stand for letters, images that complete phrases, clever visual wordplay |
| **Stripe** | Horizontal parallel lines creating form, the IBM rhythm | Shapes built from or sliced by horizontal stripes, figure-ground ambiguity, the eye completing interrupted forms |

## Visual Elements

- Perfect geometric primitives — circles, squares, rectangles, triangles — not organic or wobbly, but mathematically precise
- Bold flat color fills with no gradients, no textures, no effects — pure solid primary color
- Cut-paper collage aesthetic — shapes look like they could be arranged by hand from colored paper
- Overlapping shapes creating simple layered compositions — yellow circle partially behind red square
- Single clever substitutions — a wheel for an "O", an eye for an "I", a geometric shape standing in for a concept
- Horizontal stripe patterns slicing through forms — the IBM striping technique creating rhythm and unity
- White space used generously — shapes breathe, never crowded, the negative space is part of the design
- Thick confident black outlines on some shapes, clean edges without outlines on others
- Simple face elements — a dot for an eye, a curved line for a smile, abstracted to geometry
- Shapes that double as letters — O as circle, I as rectangle, playful letterform/shape ambiguity
- Asymmetric but balanced compositions — off-center placement that still feels stable
- Scale contrast — one large dominant shape with smaller supporting elements

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Large shape at top or center, smaller shapes grouped below, clear visual weight distribution | NeXT logo — cube dominant, company name smaller |
| Flow/process | Left-to-right sequence of shapes, visual rebus reading like a sentence | Eye-Bee-M — shapes as words in sequence |
| Connections | Overlapping circles or shapes, intersection creating relationship | Venn-diagram simplicity, shapes sharing space |
| Cycles | Circle as the containing form, elements arranged within or around | The ABC circle — everything contained in one perfect form |
| Comparison | Two or three shapes side by side, equal weight, color differentiating | Simple A/B/C options as colored geometric forms |
| Categories | Each category as a distinct geometric shape in its own primary color | Circle = type A, Square = type B, Triangle = type C |
| Unity | Single form that contains multitudes — logo that represents complex organization | IBM stripes — eight bars that ARE the letters |
| Wit | Visual pun where shape = word or concept, rebus logic | Heart + key, Eye + phone, shape standing in for language |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Paul Rand Metaphor |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Data/information | Proportionally sized circles or squares — bigger shape = more data |
| Processes | Sequence of shapes reading left-to-right like a rebus sentence |
| Systems | Interlocking geometric forms, shapes that fit together logically |
| Connections | Overlapping circles sharing space, or shapes with connecting lines |
| Growth | Smaller shape leading to larger shape, left-to-right size progression |
| Time | Horizontal stripe rhythm, reading left-to-right like a timeline |
| Hierarchy | Large circle/square at center/top, smaller supporting shapes below |
| Protection | Circle enclosing content, square containing information |
| Speed | Arrow/triangle pointing right, horizontal stripes suggesting motion |
| Stability | Square or rectangle planted firmly at base of composition |
| Users/people | Simple circle head + rectangle body, or just a circle with dot eyes |
| Ideas | Yellow circle (like a sun or lightbulb), radiating simple lines |
| Energy | Starburst of lines, or warm colors (red/yellow) in active arrangement |
| Wit | Visual pun — shape that looks like one thing but means another |

## Typography

- Clean geometric sans-serif — Futura, Helvetica, or similar rationalist faces
- Lowercase preference — more friendly and modern than all-caps shouting
- Type as a design element, integrated into the geometric composition
- Bold weights for headlines, regular or light for supporting text
- Letterspacing open and airy, never cramped
- BLACK text as the default — color used for shapes, not type
- Text can be sliced by horizontal stripes, fragmented but readable
- Playful placement — type can align with shapes, tuck under circles, interact with forms
- Hierarchy through size and weight, not through color or decoration

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT complex or detailed** — Paul Rand's genius was in reduction. If you're adding detail, you're going the wrong direction. Ask "what can I remove?" not "what can I add?"
- **NOT textured or dimensional** — No gradients, no shadows, no 3D effects, no paper textures. Pure flat color, pure geometric form.
- **NOT decorative** — No ornamental borders, no patterns for pattern's sake, no flourishes. Every element serves the idea.
- **NOT many colors** — Maximum 3-4 colors including black and white. If you're using 5+ colors, you've lost the restraint.
- **NOT busy or crowded** — White space is sacred. Shapes need room to breathe. If the composition feels full, remove elements.
- **NOT serious or corporate-stiff** — There should be wit and playfulness, even in corporate work. If it feels cold and sterile, add a clever visual pun.
- **NOT hand-drawn or organic** — Shapes are geometric and precise. Wobbly lines and organic curves belong to other styles.
- **NOT Memphis or Pop Art** — No wild pattern clashing, no comic dots, no ironic references. This is sincere, intelligent design.

## Reference Images

- Reference: IBM logo (horizontal stripes forming letters), ABC logo (lowercase in circle), NeXT cube, Westinghouse W, UPS shield, Colorforms packaging
- Look for: Geometric simplicity, primary colors on white, visual puns/rebuses, cut-paper collage aesthetic, stripe patterns, shapes as letters
