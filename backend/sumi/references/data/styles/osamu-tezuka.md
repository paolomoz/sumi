# osamu-tezuka

Big expressive eyes that sparkle with emotion, round soft faces on dynamic bodies, cinematic panel layouts borrowed from film — the "God of Manga" style: fluid motion, dramatic speed lines, and characters whose eyes contain entire universes of feeling. Every panel a camera angle, every expression a performance, every page a storyboard. This is Astro Boy soaring over a retro-futuristic Tokyo skyline, Black Jack's scalpel catching the light in a single clean ink stroke, the Phoenix spiraling through cosmic fire rendered in bold brush and screen tone. Expressive, cinematic, deeply humane.

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Astro Boy | Red + blue + chrome silver + sky blue — optimistic sci-fi heroism, clear bright day, robot adventure |
| Black Jack | Black + white + red accent + cream — stark surgical drama, heavy shadows, a single red splash of blood or scarf |
| Kimba/Leo | White + amber + green + warm yellow — warm African savanna, golden light, emotional animal storytelling |
| Phoenix | Red + orange + gold + night navy — cosmic mythology, fire and rebirth, deep space and blazing flame |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Astro Boy** | Sci-fi optimism, robot heroics, futuristic cityscapes | Chrome robots with riveted joints and expressive eyes, jetpack flame trails across blue sky, retro-futuristic cities with bubble domes and sweeping highways, hopeful upward-gazing expressions. Clean bold lines, minimal shadows, maximum clarity |
| **Black Jack** | Medical drama, stark contrast, psychological intensity | Heavy black ink dominating compositions, surgical instruments catching highlights, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, intense close-ups of eyes narrowed in concentration. The darkest variant — shadows are characters themselves |
| **Kimba/Jungle** | Nature and animals, emotional storytelling, golden warmth | Expressive animal faces with human emotion in their eyes, lush savanna environments, tears streaming in dramatic close-up, sunrise/sunset golden light suffusing every panel. The most emotionally tender variant |
| **Phoenix** | Epic mythology, cosmic scope, spiritual transformation | Flame motifs spiraling across compositions, reincarnation imagery (egg -> bird -> fire -> egg), historical settings spanning centuries, vast cosmic scales with tiny figures. The most visually ambitious variant |

## Visual Elements

- **Large round eyes with multiple highlight sparkles** — 2-3 white dot reflections in each eye, the iris a rich dark pool of expression. These eyes are windows to the soul, enormous relative to the face, capable of conveying joy, grief, determination, and wonder in a single panel. THE defining Tezuka trait
- **Simplified round faces with expressive mouths** — small button noses, wide mouths that stretch and compress for emotion, smooth cheeks with minimal detail. The face is a performance instrument, not a portrait
- **Fluid body poses with exaggerated motion and weight** — figures that lean, stretch, twist, and spring with kinetic energy. Even standing poses have weight shifts. Bodies are cartoony in proportion but dynamic in pose
- **Speed lines (concentrated lines)** — parallel lines radiating from or converging on a subject, indicating motion direction. Dense at the source, thinning outward. Appear even in non-action scenes for emotional emphasis
- **Focus/impact lines** — lines radiating outward from a central subject, drawing the eye inward. Used for dramatic reveals, emotional reactions, and moments of realization
- **Impact frames** — panel borders that crack, shatter, or deform during moments of extreme action or emotion, the content literally breaking the container
- **Cinematic camera angles** — dramatic low angles making figures heroic, bird's-eye views establishing vast scale, Dutch tilts for tension, extreme close-ups for emotion. Every panel is a deliberate directorial choice
- **Screen tone dots for mid-grays** — zip-a-tone dot patterns in various densities creating tonal values, visible as a pattern of uniform dots when examined closely. Used for shadows, skies, clothing textures
- **Clean confident ink lines with varying thickness** — thicker outlines on primary subjects, thinner details on backgrounds. Line weight varies with brush pressure — thick at beginnings and ends of strokes, thin at speed points
- **Sweat drops, tears, and emotional symbols** — the manga vocabulary of emotion: sweat drops for anxiety, streaming tears for grief, heart symbols for love, cross-popping veins for anger, all drawn with bold clean strokes
- **Retro-futuristic technology** — tube TVs with rounded screens, chrome rockets with fins, ray guns with bulbous barrels, robots with visible rivets and ball-joint limbs. The future as imagined in the 1950s-60s
- **Chibi/super-deformed reactions** — characters shrinking to simplified round forms for comedic reactions, a momentary style-break used for humor within serious narratives
- **Minimal hatching — mostly solid blacks and clean whites** — shadows rendered as bold black fills, not crosshatch gradients. The tonal range is black, white, and screen-tone gray, with little in between
- **NO photorealistic rendering, NO complex texture fills, NO airbrush effects** — the power is in clean line, solid black, and expressive simplicity

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Vertical stack with scale showing importance — giant robot looming above, normal humans below, the size difference IS the hierarchy | Astro Boy towering over the cityscape |
| Flow/process | Manga panel sequence reading left-to-right or top-to-bottom, each panel a step in the process, panel sizes varying for pacing emphasis | Page layout flow — small setup panels building to large payoff panel |
| Action/impact | Diagonal speed lines filling the panel, figure breaking through panel borders, shattered frame edges | Astro Boy punching through a wall — action shattering the container |
| Emotion/reaction | Large face close-up filling the entire panel, eyes enormous and glistening, minimal background — the face IS the content | Emotional climax — tears streaming, sparkle-filled eyes |
| Journey | Character walking/flying through changing backgrounds across multiple panels, environment shifting while the figure remains consistent | Travel montage — city to mountain to ocean in sequential panels |
| Conflict | Opposing figures facing each other with clash effect (radiating impact lines) between them, equal panel space for each side | Confrontation splash — hero vs. villain separated by explosive energy |
| Revelation | Small buildup panels (3-4 tiny frames) leading to a large dramatic reveal panel that fills half the page | Dramatic pacing — whispers before the shout |
| Scale/scope | Tiny figure silhouetted against a vast backdrop — enormous robot, cosmic landscape, futuristic city stretching to the horizon | Epic establishing shot — human smallness against grand scale |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Osamu Tezuka Metaphor |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Data/information | Scrolling screen text on retro tube monitors, robot memory bank readouts, holographic thought displays above characters' heads |
| Processes | Mechanical gears interlocking, assembly-line robots performing sequential tasks, flowing circuit paths lighting up in sequence |
| Systems | Futuristic city network seen from above — highways connecting dome buildings, power lines linking reactors, a living technological organism |
| Connections | Reaching hands across panels, eye contact bridging separate frames, radio waves rendered as concentric arcs between characters |
| Growth | Seed-to-flower sequence across panels, child aging to adult through panel progression, small panels expanding to large ones |
| Time | Clock gears spinning, hourglass draining, character aging across panels, seasons changing in background while figure stays |
| Hierarchy | Size difference — giant mentor figure looming protectively above small student, scale encoding authority and wisdom |
| Power | Energy aura radiating from figure, glowing eyes emitting light beams, transformation sequence with speed lines and light effects |
| Speed | Dense parallel speed lines filling the panel, motion blur afterimages trailing behind moving figure, panel borders stretching |
| Stability | Wide-stance grounded pose, robot planted firmly with geometric solidity, architectural base framing from below |
| Users/people | Expressive characters with distinct silhouettes — each person identifiable from their outline alone, personality encoded in body shape |
| Ideas | Lightbulb burst above head, starry sparkle in eyes, exclamation mark erupting from figure, realization rendered as radiating focus lines |
| Emotion | Tear streams, sparkle-filled eyes, blush lines across cheeks, sweat drops, the full manga emotional vocabulary |
| Transformation | Sequential panels showing metamorphosis — cocoon to butterfly, human to robot, child to hero — the Phoenix reborn from fire |
| Hope | Sunrise filling the panel with warm amber, figure gazing upward into light, clouds parting to reveal blue sky |

## Typography

- Clean Japanese-inspired sans-serif for body text — rounded, friendly, readable at any size
- Hand-lettered sound effects with motion — stretched horizontally for speed ("WHOOOOSH"), jagged edges for impact ("CRASH"), vibrating outlines for rumbling ("GRRRRR")
- Sound effects integrated into the art — text follows the action, curves with motion, radiates with explosions, never floating in separate boxes
- Speech bubbles: smooth rounded ellipses with clean pointed tails directed at the speaker
- Thought bubbles: cloud-shaped with decreasing bubble trail leading to the thinker
- Narration: clean rectangular boxes with thin borders, placed at panel edges
- Emotional outbursts: jagged spiky bubble edges, larger text inside, exclamation marks doubled
- Speed and emphasis through letter size variation — key words LARGER, supporting words smaller, within the same line
- NO Western comic block lettering, NO decorative display fonts, NO serif type — clean, rounded, and expressive

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT American superhero comics** (golden-age-comics) — No square jaws, no impossible muscles, no tiny feet on massive bodies. Tezuka anatomy is rounder, softer, more cartoony yet dynamic. No capes billowing in wind, no rippling abs. If it looks like Jack Kirby or Jim Lee, it is wrong.
- **NOT modern anime/moe style** — No extremely pointed chins, no oversized heads on impossibly thin bodies, no moe-blob proportions. Classic Tezuka is rounder and more organic, not angular. If it looks like a 2020s light novel illustration, it is wrong.
- **NOT realistic seinen manga** — No photoreference-heavy realism (Vagabond, Berserk style), no dense crosshatching for texture, no anatomically correct proportions. Tezuka is stylized and cartoony while still being emotionally powerful.
- **NOT Matsumoto-style scratchy ink** — Matsumoto's lines are nervous, rough, and deliberately messy. Tezuka's lines are clean, confident, and flowing. Both are manga, but the line quality is completely different.
- **NOT static** — Even standing poses have life: weight shifts, slight tilts, expressive hand gestures. Speed lines appear even in dialogue scenes. If figures look stiff and posed, it is wrong.
- **NOT without eye expression** — Eyes MUST be large and expressive with visible highlight sparkles. Deadpan, realistic, or small eyes destroy the entire style. The eyes carry 80% of the emotional weight.
- **NOT cluttered backgrounds** — Backgrounds serve the story: detailed when establishing location, simplified or pure white during character moments. Never competing with the figure for attention.
- **NOT Western panel layouts** — Think cinematic: extreme close-ups, dramatic camera angles, pacing through panel size variation, panels breaking and overlapping for emphasis. Not just a uniform grid of same-sized boxes.
- **NOT cute for cute's sake** — While characters are visually appealing, Tezuka tackled war, death, discrimination, and existential questions. The style carries weight, gravity, and genuine human emotion, not just kawaii charm.
- This must look like the animated pages of Astro Boy, Black Jack, and Phoenix — clean expressive linework, big sparkle-filled eyes, dramatic cinematic composition, retro-futuristic settings, and emotional depth that transcends the cartoon form. Not generic anime, not American comics, not realistic illustration.

## Best For

Tech product stories, robotics/AI content, medical/healthcare information, transformation narratives, origin stories, educational content, emotional user journeys, Japanese market localization, hopeful/optimistic messaging, science fiction concepts, ethical dilemmas, humanitarian topics, anything that benefits from cinematic storytelling, expressive character acting, and the marriage of cartoony charm with serious substance.
