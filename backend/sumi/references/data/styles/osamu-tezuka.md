# osamu-tezuka

Big expressive eyes that sparkle with emotion, round soft faces on dynamic bodies, cinematic panel layouts borrowed from film. The "God of Manga" style: fluid motion, dramatic speed lines, and characters whose eyes contain entire universes of feeling. Astro Boy meets Metropolis.

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Osamu Tezuka Metaphor |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Data/information | Scrolling screen text, robot memory banks, thought displays |
| Processes | Mechanical gears, assembly robots, flowing circuits |
| Systems | Futuristic city networks, robot internals diagram |
| Connections | Reaching hands, eye contact across panels, radio waves |
| Growth | Seed to flower sequence, child to adult, small to large panels |
| Time | Clock gears, hourglass, aging across panels, seasons |
| Hierarchy | Size difference: giant mentor, small student |
| Power | Energy aura, glowing eyes, transformation sequence |
| Speed | Dense parallel speed lines, motion blur, afterimages |
| Stability | Wide stance, grounded feet, solid geometric robot |
| Users/people | Expressive characters with distinct silhouettes |
| Ideas | Lightbulb effect, starry eyes, exclamation burst |
| Emotion | Tear streams, sparkle eyes, blush lines, sweat drops |
| Transformation | Sequence panels showing change, phoenix rebirth |
| Hope | Sunrise, upward gaze, reaching toward light |

## Typography

- Clean Japanese-inspired sans-serif for body text
- Hand-lettered sound effects with motion (stretched, vibrating)
- Sound effects integrated into art, not floating separately
- Speed and emphasis through letter stretching and size variation
- Speech bubbles: rounded with clean tails
- Thought bubbles: cloud-shaped with bubble trail
- Narration: rectangular boxes with clean borders
- Emotional outbursts: jagged bubble edges
- NO Western comic block letters. NO decorative display fonts.

## Anti-Patterns

**NOT American superhero style**: No square jaws, no impossible muscles, no tiny feet. Tezuka anatomy is rounder, softer, more cartoony yet dynamic.

**NOT modern anime/moe**: No extremely pointed chins, no oversized heads on tiny bodies, no excessive fan-service styling. Classic Tezuka is rounder, not angular.

**NOT realistic manga**: No Seinen-style detailed realism, no photoreference-heavy art. Tezuka is stylized and cartoony while still being dynamic.

**NOT static**: Even standing poses have life—weight shifts, slight tilts, expressive hands. Speed lines appear even in dialogue scenes.

**NOT without expression**: Eyes MUST be large and expressive with visible highlights. Deadpan or realistic eyes destroy the style.

**NOT cluttered backgrounds**: Backgrounds serve story—detailed when establishing location, simplified or abstract during character moments.

**NOT Western panel layouts**: Think cinematic—extreme close-ups, dramatic angles, pacing through panel size variation. Not just grid layouts.

**NOT cute for cute's sake**: While characters are appealing, Tezuka tackled war, death, discrimination. The style carries weight and emotion, not just kawaii.
