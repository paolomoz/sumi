# technical-schematic

The visual language of engineering blueprints, patent drawings, and technical manuals — precise orthographic projections, callout lines with numbered labels, exploded views showing how parts assemble. Thin precise lines on blue-tinted or white grounds, the aesthetic of things designed to be built. Cross-sections revealing internal structure, hidden lines shown dashed, centerlines marking axes of symmetry. This is the marriage of technical accuracy and visual clarity that lets someone who has never seen an object understand how to manufacture it. Function over form, information over decoration, precision as beauty.

## Color Palette

- Background: Blueprint blue (#F0F8FF), engineering white (#FFFFFF), aged cream (#FAFAD2)
- Lines: Technical black (#000000), blueprint dark blue (#191970), technical gray (#4A4A4A)
- Accent: Single highlight color for emphasis — red (#FF0000) for warnings, orange (#FF8C00) for attention
- Hidden lines: Dashed in lighter gray (#808080) or lighter blue
- Section fills: Cross-hatch patterns, section lining, material indicators
- Dimensions: Black or dark gray, clearly separated from object lines
- Centerlines: Long-dash-short-dash pattern in fine weight

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Blueprint Classic | White lines on cyan blue background — the original reproduction technique |
| Technical Modern | Black on white, clean contemporary engineering |
| Patent Drawing | Black on cream/aged paper — historical document aesthetic |
| Highlighted | Black/gray + single red accent — emphasis on key parts |
| CAD Style | Black with layer colors — blue dimensions, green center, red hidden |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Blueprint** | Traditional cyanotype aesthetic, reversed colors | White/light lines on blue ground |
| **Exploded** | Assembly view, parts separated along axes | Components pulled apart showing relationships |
| **Cross-Section** | Cut-away revealing internal structure | Section plane, hatched cut surfaces |
| **Orthographic** | Multiple views — front, side, top | Standard engineering projections |
| **Patent** | Historical patent drawing style | Numbered callouts, formal presentation |

## Visual Elements

- **Precise line weights** — hierarchy through thickness: object lines heavy, dimension lines light, center lines lightest
- **Orthographic views** — front, side, top/plan views in standard arrangement
- **Exploded assemblies** — parts separated along assembly axes, showing fit
- **Dimension lines** — measurements with witness lines, arrows, numeric values
- **Callout leaders** — lines with arrows pointing to features, numbered references
- **Hidden lines** — dashed lines showing obscured edges
- **Center lines** — long-short-long dash pattern marking axes of symmetry
- **Section views** — cut planes revealed, hatched to show solid material
- **Detail views** — magnified areas for complex features
- **Cross-hatching** — 45° parallel lines indicating cut surfaces
- **Break lines** — zigzag or wavy lines showing shortened objects
- **Scale notation** — ratio or "not to scale" indicator
- **Arrowheads** — clean, consistent arrow styles on dimension and leader lines
- **Title block** — drawing number, scale, revision, drafter information

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Assembly | Exploded view with numbered parts, assembly order shown | Product manual, how it goes together |
| Anatomy | Labeled parts, callouts to features | Technical identification |
| Comparison | Before/after, old/new, options side by side | Engineering alternatives |
| Process | Sequential manufacturing steps | Fabrication instructions |
| System | Multiple views showing full object | Complete technical documentation |
| Detail | Zoomed areas for critical features | Close-up callouts, section details |
| Relationship | How parts connect, interfaces and fits | Assembly relationships |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Technical Schematic Metaphor |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Data/information | Dimensions, specifications, numerical annotations |
| Processes | Assembly sequence, manufacturing steps |
| Systems | Complete orthographic documentation, multiple views |
| Connections | How parts interface, fit relationships |
| Structure | Internal anatomy revealed through section views |
| Hierarchy | Visual weight — thicker lines more important |
| Precision | Dimensional accuracy, measured specifications |
| Hidden complexity | Dashed lines, section views revealing interior |
| Components | Exploded parts, numbered elements |
| Standards | Consistent conventions, professional expectations |
| Function | How it works, mechanical relationships |
| Manufacturing | Fabrication information, build instructions |

## Typography

- **Technical sans-serif** — DIN, ISOCPEUR, machine-style lettering
- **ALL CAPS traditionally** — engineering convention, easier to hand-letter consistently
- **Consistent lettering height** — dimensioning text smaller than title text
- **Horizontal orientation** — all text readable from bottom or right
- **Roman numerals or letters** — for figure callouts, part identification
- **Fraction notation** — proper engineering fraction display
- **Notes section** — supplementary text in structured format
- **Title block typography** — formal identification information

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT decorative** — every line serves a purpose, no ornamentation
- **NOT artistic** — technical accuracy over aesthetic expression
- **NOT perspective** — orthographic/parallel projection only, no vanishing points
- **NOT colorful** — limited palette, color only for technical purpose
- **NOT sketchy** — clean, precise, drafted lines
- **NOT 3D rendered** — line drawings, not photorealistic rendering
- **NOT hand-drawn style** — even if hand-drafted, precision is the goal
- **NOT infographic** — this is engineering documentation, not data visualization
- This must look like actual technical documentation — patent drawings, engineering blueprints, assembly instructions — precise, clear, buildable.

## Best For

Technical explanations, how-it-works content, product documentation, engineering topics, DIY and assembly instructions, anatomy and structure, manufacturing and industrial topics, anything requiring precise technical clarity.
