# kawaii

Round, soft, impossibly cute — the Japanese aesthetic of adorable taken to its logical extreme. Giant sparkling eyes taking up half the face, tiny dot mouths expressing pure joy, blush marks on cheeks that have never known hardship. Everything is simplified to maximum cuteness: sharp corners become curves, complex forms become bouncy blobs, even inanimate objects sprout faces and smiles. Pastel colors so soft they feel edible, like candy and clouds and cotton had a baby. This is the visual language of Sanrio, LINE stickers, and every kawaii mascot that's ever made you go "awww." Aggressive adorableness as a design strategy.

## Typography

- Rounded sans-serif fonts — soft, friendly letterforms with no sharp points
- Bubble letters — inflated, soft, playful typography that matches character roundness
- Handwritten style — gentle, slightly wobbly lines suggesting a friendly personal touch
- Japanese aesthetic fonts — fonts that evoke Japanese cute culture, POP style lettering
- Lowercase preference — feels friendlier and less serious than all-caps
- Decorated letters — small hearts, stars, or sparkles incorporated into or around text
- Soft colors for text — pink, soft brown, lavender rather than harsh black
- Speech bubbles with rounded corners, soft edges, sometimes cloud-shaped or heart-shaped

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT sharp or angular** — kawaii has no hard edges, no pointed corners, no aggressive geometry.
- **NOT dark or saturated colors** — the palette is soft, pastel, gentle. No bold primaries, no dark moody colors.
- **NOT realistic** — everything is simplified, stylized, abstracted to maximum cute. No detailed anatomy.
- **NOT serious** — kawaii is inherently playful. Even sad kawaii characters are adorably sad.
- **NOT minimalist** — kawaii is decorative, with sparkles, blush marks, and cute accessories. It's not stripped-down simplicity.
- **NOT chibi anime** — while related, kawaii is softer and rounder than typical anime chibi. More Sanrio, less anime.
- **NOT ironic** — kawaii is earnestly cute, not winking at the viewer. The cuteness is genuine.
- This must look like something Sanrio would produce — round, soft, sparkling, pastel, and impossible not to smile at. If it doesn't make you want to go "awww," it's not kawaii enough.
