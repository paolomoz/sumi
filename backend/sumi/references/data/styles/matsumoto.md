# matsumoto

Loose, scratchy black ink on rough paper — tangled power lines snagging across a narrow Tokyo alley, a kid with an oversized head perched on a rooftop, concrete walls covered in half-peeled posters and rain streaks. Every line vibrates with nervous energy, every ink splatter is left in on purpose, every perspective tilts and swoops like a camera strapped to a running cat. This is Tekkonkinkreet's Treasure Town drawn with a brush dipped in espresso, Moebius visiting Shimokitazawa, the beautiful mess of a city that refuses to be tidy. Raw, kinetic, deeply human.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Dense sumi black ink (#0A0A0A) — the backbone of everything, applied with brush and pen in varying densities from rich velvety black to thin scratchy gray
- Background: Rough off-white paper (#F0E6D0) with visible grain and slight yellowing, like a well-thumbed manga page
- Grays: Concrete gray (#8B8B8B), asphalt gray (#6B6B6B), weathered wall gray (#A8A8A0), rain-puddle gray (#7A7A7A) — ink wash tones for shadows and buildings
- Accents: Washed-out sky blue (#A8C8E8), warm sunset orange (#E8915A), rust red (#C85A4A), weathered teal (#6B9B8A), faded signage pink (#D4888A)
- Twilight: Dusty purple (#9B8BA8) and faded indigo (#5A6B8B) for evening scenes
- Text: Black ink on paper, or white reversed out of dense ink areas — always hand-lettered in feel, never crisp digital

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Daytime Alley | Black ink + concrete grays + washed-out sky blue + rust red accent (a single red sign or mailbox in a gray urban scene) |
| Sunset Rooftop | Black ink + warm sunset orange wash + dusty purple sky + silhouetted buildings in dense black |
| Rainy Street | Black ink + blue-gray washes + weathered teal + wet asphalt reflections in diluted ink |
| Paper & Ink | Black ink only on off-white paper — pure pen and brush, no color, maximum line energy. The most Matsumoto combination |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Tekkonkinkreet** | Dense urban chaos, vertiginous cityscapes, tangled wires | Bird's-eye rooftop perspectives looking down into narrow alleys crammed with signs, pipes, air conditioners, power lines crossing like a web — the city as overwhelming living organism. Black ink dominant, minimal color washes |
| **Ping Pong** | Kinetic figure energy, speed and motion, emotional expression | Exaggerated body poses with extended limbs, motion blur rendered as loose scratchy lines radiating outward, faces contorted with effort or joy — the human body as expressive instrument. Minimal background, maximum figure energy |
| **Sunny** | Quiet melancholy, intimate domestic spaces, warm light | Interior scenes with warm golden-orange light streaming through windows, cluttered rooms with books and toys, small figures in big spaces — loneliness rendered tenderly. Soft watercolor washes over gentle ink lines |
| **Sketch** | Raw process, unfinished edges, visible construction | Ink drawings that look mid-process — some areas rendered in dense crosshatching, others barely sketched with a single loose line, white paper showing through everywhere. Pencil underdrawing visible beneath ink. The most raw variant |

## Visual Elements

- **Loose, varying ink lines** — lines that breathe and wobble, thick where the brush presses down, thin where it lifts, sometimes breaking apart into dry-brush texture. Never uniform, never mechanical. The line itself has personality
- **Dense crosshatching for shadows** — tight parallel pen lines layered at angles to build up dark areas, visible as individual strokes, not blended into smooth gray. The hatching direction follows the form's contour
- **Ink splatters and drips left in** — accidental marks kept as texture. A splatter of ink near a figure's foot, a drip running down from a rooftop — the drawing process is visible and celebrated
- **Tangled power lines and utility wires** — thin ink lines crisscrossing the upper portion of compositions like a nervous system stretched across the sky. The single most recognizable Matsumoto environmental detail
- **Dense urban layering** — buildings stacked behind buildings, signs overlapping signs, pipes running along walls, air conditioners jutting out, drainage gutters, rusted railings. Nothing is isolated; everything is crammed together like a real Japanese backstreet
- **Exaggerated character proportions** — oversized round heads on small wiry bodies, or elongated limbs on tiny torsos. Faces drawn with minimal lines but maximum expression — two dots for eyes and a slash for a mouth conveying worlds of emotion
- **Dynamic tilted perspectives** — compositions tilted 10-30 degrees off-axis, creating a dizzy vertiginous feeling. Bird's-eye views looking straight down into alleys. Extreme foreshortening on figures running toward or away from the viewer
- **Watercolor washes bleeding past line boundaries** — when color is used, it's applied loosely, bleeding beyond the ink lines, pooling in some areas and leaving others dry. Never fills shapes precisely, never respects outlines
- **Visible paper texture** — the grain of rough drawing paper showing through, especially in lighter areas. Ink behaves differently on rough paper — drier, more textured, with visible fiber pull
- **Rooftop silhouettes** — figures and structures silhouetted against sky, rendered in solid dense black with rough edges. A kid standing on a water tower, antenna poles against sunset, laundry lines against clouds
- **Hand-written text and signage** — Japanese shop signs, street numbers, and labels drawn by hand in ink, slightly wonky, part of the urban texture rather than overlaid typography
- **Half-peeled posters and weathered surfaces** — walls with layers of aging, torn paper remnants, rain streaks, stained concrete, rust spots. Every surface tells a story of time passing
- **NO clean digital lines, NO smooth gradients, NO airbrushed shading** — everything looks drawn by hand with a brush, pen, and watercolors on real paper

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Vertical cityscape — tallest buildings at back rendered as silhouettes, mid-ground with detailed ink work, foreground with loose sketchy figures. Importance mapped to rendering density, not size | Tekkonkinkreet cityscapes — layers of urban depth receding upward |
| Flow/process | Meandering alley path weaving between dense buildings, each turn revealing a new scene. The path itself is sketched loosely, buildings crowding in from both sides | Walking through Treasure Town — each panel a new alley corner |
| Connections | Tangled power lines connecting buildings/nodes — wires droop and cross between utility poles, each connection point a cluster of ink marks | Power line networks spanning between rooftops |
| Cycles | Circular rooftop view — looking down into a courtyard or intersection from above, buildings radiating outward, the cycle mapped around the view's rotation | Vertiginous bird's-eye Tekkonkinkreet panels |
| Comparison | Split scene — day vs. night of the same street, or rainy vs. sunny. Left side in line-only ink, right side with watercolor wash. Same composition, different mood | Matsumoto's tonal range within a single spread |
| Categories | Different buildings on a street, each with its own sign, awning, and character — categories as shops along an alley, each rendered with different detail density | Treasure Town's diverse shop fronts |
| Growth | Ascending perspective — looking up from street level at buildings growing taller, converging toward a small patch of sky tangled with wires | Ground-level to rooftop vertical sweep |
| Networks | Rooftop view with intersecting streets below — a web of alleys and paths seen from above, each intersection a node, rendered in dense bird's-eye ink work | Tekkonkinkreet aerial city maps |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Matsumoto Metaphor |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Data/information | Density of ink marks — more data = denser crosshatching and more detailed rendering. Less data = loose sketchy lines with white paper showing through |
| Processes | Path through an alley — each step is a turn in the street, revealed as you walk through dense urban scenery |
| Systems | Tangled power line network — wires connecting poles and buildings in a chaotic but functional web |
| Connections | Power lines drooping between utility poles, or alley paths connecting building clusters |
| Growth | Buildings ascending from street level, getting taller and more silhouetted against the sky |
| Time | Day-to-night transition — same scene shifting from clean line art (morning) to dense ink wash (night) |
| Hierarchy | Rendering density: most important elements get the densest crosshatching and most detailed ink work; lesser elements are barely sketched |
| Protection | Dense ink enclosure — a building or wall rendered in heavy black surrounding lighter interior space |
| Speed | Radiating scratchy speed lines bursting from a figure in motion, limbs elongated with momentum |
| Stability | Solid black silhouette anchoring the composition — a water tower, a bridge pylon, a concrete wall rendered in dense velvety black |
| Users/people | Exaggerated manga figures — oversized round heads, thin wiry limbs, minimal facial features conveying maximum emotion. Small figures in big urban spaces |
| Ideas | A lightbulb or spark rendered as a quick ink splash surrounded by radiating pen scratches — spontaneous, messy, alive |
| Energy | Dense overlapping ink strokes, splatters, and speed lines — the page feels like it's vibrating with kinetic force |
| Tension/conflict | Dark vs. light — heavy black ink encroaching on white paper space, shadows swallowing light, dense rendering clashing with empty space |

## Typography

- Hand-lettered feel — text that looks written with a brush pen or marker, not typed. Slightly uneven baselines, variable stroke width
- Condensed, angular letterforms with raw energy — like signage scrawled on a concrete wall
- Mixed case, leaning slightly forward like someone writing quickly under a streetlight
- Title text can be drawn large and loose, with visible brush texture in the strokes
- Labels integrated into the urban scene — text on shop signs, street markers, wall graffiti rather than floating in clean boxes
- Black ink text on paper, or reversed white text knocked out of dense black areas
- Numbers rendered large and hand-drawn with visible ink texture — "3 steps" should look spray-painted on a wall
- NO clean sans-serif, NO geometric precision, NO digital perfection — everything should feel drawn, not set

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT sumi-e** — Sumi-e is zen minimalism, serene nature, controlled philosophical brushwork on pristine paper. Matsumoto is urban chaos, nervous energy, gritty human mess on rough paper. If it looks peaceful and spiritual, it is wrong.
- **NOT clean manga** — No screen tones, no uniform line weights, no sparkly eyes, no speed-line conventions from mainstream shounen/shoujo. This is underground, European-influenced, independent comics art. If it looks like Naruto or One Piece, it is wrong.
- **NOT storybook watercolor** — Storybook watercolor (Studio Ghibli style) is soft, gentle, and whimsical. Matsumoto's watercolor is raw, urban, with black ink grit underneath. If it looks like a children's fairy tale, it is wrong.
- **NOT street art/graffiti style** (Keith Haring, Banksy) — Though influenced by urban texture, this is hand-drawn illustration on paper, not spray-paint graphics on walls. The graffiti is in the environment depicted, not the drawing technique used.
- **NOT architectural illustration** — Matsumoto's buildings are wonky, expressive, and alive. If the perspective is geometrically perfect and the lines are straight and ruled, it is wrong. Buildings should lean, sag, and breathe.
- **NOT bold-graphic/comic pop** (pop-art-lichtenstein, golden-age-comics) — No halftone dots, no clean pop-art outlines, no saturated flat fills. This is messy, textured ink on paper with visible process marks.
- **NOT Moebius** — Moebius crosshatching is obsessive, patient, meditative with luminous pastel washes and vast empty skies. Matsumoto's ink work is nervous, urgent, scratchy with rough urban energy. Both crosshatch, but the rhythm and mood are completely different.
- This must look like pages torn from a sketchbook carried through Tokyo backstreets — ink-stained, coffee-ringed, spontaneous, raw, and full of nervous life. Not a polished illustration; a living drawing that still smells of wet ink.

## Best For

Urban topics, technology and city life, social commentary, street culture, music and counterculture, personal stories, emotional narratives, anything that benefits from raw expressive energy, gritty authenticity, and the feeling of a city that's alive and messy rather than clean and designed.
