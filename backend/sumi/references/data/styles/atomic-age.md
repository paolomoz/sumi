# atomic-age

Flat, stylized mid-century modern illustration bursting with atomic optimism — turquoise and orange shapes floating on cream backgrounds, starburst clocks ticking on the wall, boomerang coffee tables on tapered legs, and jaunty little characters with pointy shoes striding confidently into the Space Age. This is a 1955 children's science book, a Googie diner placemat, a Saul Bass title sequence — playful, confident, and irresistibly retro.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Atomic orange (#E8601C), turquoise/teal (#1FBFB8), mustard yellow (#E5A535)
- Background: Warm cream (#F5ECD7), soft off-white with subtle paper grain — never cold sterile white
- Darks: Charcoal gray (#3D3D3D), olive green (#5E6B3A) — used for outlines, text, and anchoring shapes
- Accents: Coral pink (#E8837C), avocado green (#6B8F3C), robin's egg blue (#78CDD1), brick red (#B5403A)
- Text: Charcoal on cream; white or cream on colored panels; never pure black — always slightly warm

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Classic Atomic | Turquoise + atomic orange + mustard + cream — the quintessential 1950s triad, warm and optimistic |
| Diner | Coral pink + mint green + chrome silver + cream + charcoal — milkshake-counter nostalgia |
| Space Age | Robin's egg blue + charcoal + white + orange accent — cool, clean, NASA-era confidence |
| Harvest | Avocado green + mustard + burnt orange + cream — earthy, warm, autumn-toned mid-century |
| Palm Springs | Turquoise + white + coral + warm wood brown — poolside desert modernism |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Atomic** | Starburst and orbit motifs, science-fiction optimism | Radiating starburst shapes, electron orbit paths, boomerang and diamond forms, Sputnik-inspired elements floating against cream — the Atomic Age as joyful illustration |
| **Googie** | Jet-age architecture, swooping angles, neon signage | Swept rooflines, angled supports like rocket fins, bold signage with arrow shapes, turquoise and orange palette — the roadside coffee shop as futuristic vision |
| **Charley Harper** | Minimalist nature illustration, extreme shape reduction | Animals and plants reduced to pure geometric shapes — circles, triangles, ovals — with bold flat color fills, no gradients, negative space as active design element |
| **Saul Bass** | Bold graphic cutout style, dramatic simple shapes | Torn-paper silhouettes, strong figure/ground contrast, limited 2-3 color palette, cinematic tension through simple geometric forms — movie poster as infographic |

## Visual Elements

- Starburst/atomic star shapes: sharp multi-pointed stars radiating from a center, like a sparkle or a retro wall clock — the single most iconic mid-century motif
- Boomerang and kidney-bean shapes: asymmetric curved forms used as dividers, containers, and decorative accents — organic but geometric, like a coffee table viewed from above
- Tapered legs and atomic supports: thin angled lines tapering to points, holding up shapes like mid-century furniture legs — everything hovers slightly off the ground
- Electron orbit paths: thin elliptical rings orbiting around central circles, suggesting atoms — science made decorative and friendly
- Diamond/rhombus grid patterns: tilted squares repeating as background texture, like a 1950s kitchen backsplash
- Flat color fills with no gradients: each shape is a single solid color, cleanly bounded — the flat illustration look is essential
- Simplified figures with exaggerated proportions: people as stylized shapes with small heads, long limbs, pointy shoes, triangular torsos — charming, not realistic
- Googie-style swooping angles: roof shapes that swoop upward at the ends, arrow-like pointers, boomerang curves suggesting forward motion and jet-age speed
- Thin outline strokes in charcoal: shapes outlined with consistent thin dark lines, slightly offset from the fill color, giving a hand-drawn screen-print quality
- Paper texture grain: subtle warm grain visible in the cream background and through color fills, like risograph or screen-print on good cardstock
- Abstract botanical shapes: simple leaf forms, circles-on-sticks suggesting flowers or trees — nature reduced to geometric shorthand
- NO photorealism, NO gradients, NO drop shadows, NO glossy effects — everything is flat, graphic, and printed

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Ascending shapes on tapered legs, tallest at center — like a display of mid-century vases on a shelf, each level a different height and color | Charley Harper's layered landscape compositions |
| Flow/process | Boomerang-shaped path curving through the composition, with numbered starburst markers at each step | Googie signage arrows pointing the way forward |
| Connections | Electron orbit ellipses linking circular nodes — an atomic model where each electron is a content item orbiting a central concept | 1950s science textbook atom diagrams |
| Cycles | Circular arrangement of shapes connected by orbit rings, the whole thing spinning like an atom or a retro clock face | Sputnik chandelier — arms radiating from a center hub |
| Comparison | Split composition with a boomerang divider down the middle — left side one color, right side contrasting color, shapes mirrored but different | Split-screen Saul Bass compositions |
| Categories | Shapes arranged on a diamond grid, each category a different color, with starburst dividers between groups | 1950s kitchen tile patterns organizing different items |
| Growth | Ascending starburst shapes getting larger and more elaborate from left to right, each on increasingly tall tapered legs | Bar chart reimagined as a row of atomic starbursts |
| Networks | Hub-and-spoke with electron orbits — central circle with elliptical paths reaching out to satellite circles, like a friendly atom model | Sputnik satellite with radiating antennae |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Atomic Age Metaphor |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Data/information | Colored circles and starbursts of proportional size, like planets in a retro solar system |
| Processes | Boomerang-shaped arrow path with numbered starburst steps along the curve |
| Systems | Atom model — central nucleus circle with electron orbits connecting component circles |
| Connections | Thin orbit ellipses linking circles, like electrons shared between atoms |
| Growth | Ascending row of starbursts on tapered legs, each taller and more elaborate |
| Time | Horizontal timeline with starburst markers, connected by a thin boomerang curve |
| Hierarchy | Vertical arrangement like a display shelf — tallest/most important at center, flanked by smaller elements |
| Protection | Kidney-bean or boomerang shape enclosing protected content, like a retro TV screen frame |
| Speed | Swooping Googie arrow shapes, horizontal speed lines, jet-age pointed forms |
| Stability | Wide triangular base on tapered legs, like a solid piece of mid-century furniture |
| Users/people | Stylized flat figures with small round heads, triangular torsos, long thin legs, pointy shoes — charming and jaunty |
| Ideas | Radiating starburst with a light bulb or atom at center — a bright spark of atomic-age inspiration |
| Energy | Multiple overlapping starbursts in warm colors (orange, yellow, coral) — visual fizz and pop |

## Typography

- Clean sans-serif with personality — slightly rounded letterforms, not sterile geometric
- Playful baseline variation: letters can bounce slightly, creating friendly rhythm without looking sloppy
- Mixed case preferred for body text — lowercase feels more approachable than all-caps
- Titles can use display-weight condensed sans-serif with tight tracking
- Script or brush lettering for accent words — a single word in casual script adds warmth (use sparingly)
- Text often placed at jaunty angles, tilted 5-10 degrees, not always perfectly horizontal
- Color-coded labels: each category gets its own color, matching the shape it labels
- NO formal serif faces, NO blackletter, NO heavy decorative type — everything is light, airy, and modern

## Anti-Patterns

- NOT a realistic 1950s photograph or vintage filter — this is flat stylized illustration, not retro photography
- NOT pixel art or 8-bit — mid-century modern is smooth curves and clean shapes, not pixelated
- NOT corporate Memphis — though both are flat illustration, MCM has a specific warm retro color palette, starburst motifs, and tapered-leg furniture vocabulary that corporate Memphis lacks
- NOT psychedelic or 1960s hippie — atomic age is clean, optimistic, and structured, not swirly and chaotic
- NOT Art Deco — no gold, no black, no metallic sheen, no ziggurats. MCM is warm, colorful, and playful where Deco is formal and opulent
- This must look like a page from a 1955 Golden Book or a Charley Harper wildlife print, not a generic flat vector illustration
