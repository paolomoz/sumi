# saul-bass

Bold paper cutout shapes slicing across the frame like torn construction paper — dramatic black silhouettes of reaching hands with angular separated fingers, faceless running figures frozen at maximum drama, jagged geometric fragments of human bodies scattered across cream ground. A single punchy orange-red accent bleeds through the black-and-white composition. This is the desperate hand reaching through vertical bars in The Man with the Golden Arm, the spiraling bodies in Vertigo, the fragmented corpse in Anatomy of a Murder. Movie poster urgency distilled into sharp-edged paper-cut drama.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Jet black (#000000), Saul Bass orange-red (#E34234), warm cream (#FDF5E6)
- Background: Warm cream (#FDF5E6), stark white (#FFFFFF), or solid black (#000000) — always maximum contrast, never mid-tone gray backgrounds
- Accents: Mustard yellow (#E8B923), olive green (#5C6B4A), brick red (#9B3D3D), teal (#2A7B7F) — used ONE AT A TIME as the single accent per composition, never multiple accent colors together
- Text: Black on cream/white only, or reversed white/cream knocked out of black areas only — text is NEVER colored, always at maximum contrast

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Classic | Black + orange-red + cream — the quintessential Saul Bass triad. Vertigo, Anatomy of a Murder, West Side Story. Black figures on cream with one element punched in hot orange-red |
| Silhouette | Pure black figures on stark white ground, with a single small orange-red accent element — a hand, a circle, a bar. Maximum graphic impact through maximum restraint |
| Inverted | White/cream cutout shapes on solid black ground, with orange-red highlight element — nighttime noir drama, figures emerging from darkness |
| Earth Accent | Black + cream + one restrained earth tone (olive green OR mustard yellow OR teal) — a more sophisticated, subdued variation for quieter dramatic moments |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Cutout** | Torn paper edges, layered silhouettes, visible craft aesthetic | Shapes that look physically hand-cut from black construction paper with slightly ragged, imperfect edges — not smooth bezier curves but tactile torn-paper roughness. Overlapping layers create simple depth: one black shape over cream, then a cream shape cut from that, creating a figure-ground oscillation |
| **Silhouette** | Pure black figures against solid color ground, zero interior detail | Human forms reduced to their most dramatic outline — a man running with coat flapping, a hand reaching with fingers splayed, a body falling in spiral. You know EXACTLY what the figure is doing but cannot see a single facial feature. The pose IS the communication |
| **Fragmented** | Figures shattered into geometric angular pieces, cubist influence | A face split into three angled black planes with cream gaps between. An arm severed into separate black parallelogram shapes floating near each other. A body broken apart like a dropped paper doll — still recognizable as human action but geometrically decomposed |
| **Bars/Stripes** | Thick vertical or diagonal bars slicing across the entire composition | Bold parallel stripes (4-6 bars, black on cream or cream on black) cutting through figures, fragmenting them into glimpses seen between prison bars. The "trapped" motif from The Man with the Golden Arm — figures reaching through, straining against, obscured behind thick recurring bars |

## Visual Elements

- **Jagged paper-cut silhouettes with rough hand-torn edges** — not smooth vector curves but tactile craft edges where the paper ripped slightly unevenly. You can almost feel the construction paper tearing under scissors. This imperfection IS the energy
- **Human figures reduced to pure black shapes** — no facial features, no interior anatomy, no clothing detail. Just the dramatic outline of a POSE: reaching, running, falling, grasping, spiraling. The silhouette communicates everything through body language alone
- **Reaching hands with separated angular fingers** — each finger a distinct sharp black triangle or parallelogram, spread apart like a starfish. The hand reaching from below, from the side, through bars — always grasping, always desperate, always dramatic
- **Thick vertical or diagonal bars/stripes slicing across the frame** — 4-6 bold parallel bars fragmenting the composition, creating rhythm, entrapment, and visual tension. Figures visible between bars in glimpses
- **Spiral compositions** — bodies tumbling in circular descent, the Vertigo motion of falling down a stairwell. Figures repeated at different rotations around a center point, creating a vortex of human drama
- **Single bold accent color punching through monochrome** — one orange-red arm in a field of black figures, one colored circle in a black-and-white composition. The accent color appears ONCE and demands attention through its rarity
- **Overlapping paper layers with visible edges** — black shape overlapping cream shape overlapping black, creating simple depth through physical overlay, as if actual paper sheets are stacked
- **Figures in maximum-drama motion** — running with coat flying, falling with arms outstretched, reaching desperately upward, grasping at nothing. Every figure frozen at the most dramatic possible moment of their action
- **Negative space as active design element** — white/cream shapes are not empty background but active figures cut from black fields. A white hand appears because black surrounds it, not because white was painted
- **Geometric fragmentation of human bodies** — faces as intersecting triangular planes, torsos as overlapping parallelograms, limbs as separated angular shards. The figure is RECOGNIZABLE but DECOMPOSED
- **Bold flat shapes with absolutely no gradients** — no shading, no dimensional rendering, no soft edges, no atmospheric effects. Pure graphic flat silhouette. Two values only: black and not-black
- **Asymmetric dynamic compositions** — figures positioned off-center, reaching toward or fleeing from frame edges, weight concentrated in one area creating visual tension and imbalance
- **Eyes as simple white shapes** — when faces appear at all, eyes are just white circles or ovals cut from black, sometimes a spiral or concentric circle. The simplest possible facial feature

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Large dominant black silhouette figure at center, with smaller supporting shapes radiating outward or fragmented around it, thick bars subdividing the negative space | The Man with the Golden Arm — massive arm reaching upward through vertical bars, smaller elements below |
| Flow/process | Figure in motion across the frame from left to right, body fragmented into sequential stages — the same figure repeated as overlapping silhouettes showing progressive movement | Anatomy of a Murder — horizontal body breaking into angular pieces across the frame |
| Connections | Reaching hands from opposite directions, fingers nearly touching across a gap of cream negative space — the tension lives in the GAP, not the hands | West Side Story — two competing forces reaching toward the center, almost meeting |
| Cycles | Spiral of falling or rotating figure silhouettes, circular descent pattern pulling inward, vertigo motion | Vertigo — bodies tumbling in concentric spiral toward a central point |
| Comparison | Frame split vertically or diagonally with contrasting silhouettes on each side — same pose in black-on-cream vs. cream-on-black, a single orange-red accent bridging the divide | Walk on the Wild Side — opposing compositions reflected across a dividing line |
| Categories | Each category rendered as one distinct bold silhouette shape, arranged in a loose grid or scattered across white ground — each icon instantly recognizable through pose alone | Symbol system — each concept reduced to one iconic hand-cut paper shape |
| Tension | Thick bars fragmenting a trapped figure — hands and face visible between stripes, reaching through, straining against visual imprisonment | The Man with the Golden Arm — desperation, entrapment, the figure versus the bars |
| Networks | Multiple small silhouette figures scattered across the field, connected by shared gesture — all reaching the same direction, all running the same way, unified by parallel action | Exodus — a crowd of abstracted human shapes moving as one body in one direction |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Saul Bass Metaphor |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Data/information | Proportionally sized black silhouette shapes on cream — larger form = more importance. The visual weight of the shape IS the data value |
| Processes | Fragmented figure in sequential motion across the frame — body parts distributed left-to-right showing the stages of a single action, like a film strip exploded |
| Systems | Interlocking angular black shapes fitting together like a cut-paper jigsaw puzzle — each piece necessary, the whole forming a recognizable figure |
| Connections | Reaching hands from different directions, angular fingers extending toward each other across cream negative space — the connection is the tension in the gap between them |
| Growth | Expanding spiral from center outward, or running figure ascending along a diagonal from lower-left to upper-right, silhouette getting larger with each step |
| Time | Left-to-right sequence of fragmented body positions, motion blur achieved through repeated overlapping black shapes shifting incrementally — time as sequential decomposition |
| Hierarchy | Large dominant central silhouette with smaller supporting shapes positioned beneath and around it — size IS rank, position IS power |
| Protection | Figure enclosed within thick vertical bars or a bold black frame border, arms reaching outward through the containment — protection and imprisonment are the same image |
| Speed | Diagonal thrust from lower-left to upper-right, figure leaning forward with trailing edge fragmenting into angular shards — speed as decomposition |
| Stability | Solid black rectangle or square anchoring the bottom of the composition, a vertical figure planted firmly with feet apart — weight and groundedness |
| Users/people | Black silhouette figures — completely faceless but instantly recognizable through POSE and GESTURE alone. A figure running = urgency. A figure reaching = need. A figure standing = authority |
| Ideas | Starburst or lightbulb shape rendered as angular cut-paper form with sharp torn edges — ideas as sharp shapes bursting from black ground |
| Energy | Explosive fragmentation — shapes bursting outward from center, angular shards flying, diagonal lines of force slashing across the composition |
| Tension/conflict | Two hands reaching toward each other but NOT touching, figures separated by thick bars, bodies in opposition — drama lives in the space BETWEEN forms |

## Typography

- Bold condensed sans-serif, often custom hand-lettered to match the cut-paper aesthetic — letters themselves look hand-cut from paper
- Headlines treated as graphic elements — text is a SHAPE in the composition, not floating separately above or below the imagery. Title integrates with the silhouettes
- Letters can be CUT FROM the composition — white letter shapes knocked out of black areas, or black letters stamped onto cream areas, as if die-cut through paper
- Vertically stacked lettering common — words reading downward in a narrow column alongside vertical figures or bars
- Slight imperfection in letter shapes — mimicking the hand-cut quality of physical paper letters, not digitally perfect kerning and curves
- BLACK TEXT ONLY — text is NEVER colored, never orange-red, never any accent color. Always black on light or white/cream knocked out of black
- Uppercase preferred for titles and headlines — bold, condensed, commanding
- Text integrated into negative space — sitting in the cream gaps between black shapes, working WITH the silhouette composition rather than overlaid on top of it

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT Art Deco** — Art Deco is SYMMETRICAL, ORNAMENTAL, gold-leafed geometric luxury with sunbursts and ziggurats. Saul Bass is RAW, URGENT, ASYMMETRIC, and stripped of all decoration. No geometric borders, no gilded elements, no balanced symmetry. If it looks elegant and luxurious, it's wrong.
- **NOT polished vector graphics** — shapes MUST have a hand-crafted, slightly rough paper-cut quality. Perfectly smooth bezier curves with uniform stroke weights destroy the tactile energy entirely. Edges should feel TORN and IMPERFECT, not machined or computer-generated.
- **NOT colorful** — this is fundamentally BLACK + WHITE/CREAM + ONE ACCENT COLOR. Multiple colors working together in harmony destroys the graphic impact. If it looks like it uses a "palette," it's wrong. Two colors plus one rare accent.
- **NOT literal or detailed** — Saul Bass figures are abstracted to PURE SILHOUETTE. No interior detail, no faces, no realistic anatomy, no clothing texture. If you can identify the figure's facial expression or read their name tag, far too much detail has been added.
- **NOT symmetrical or balanced** — compositions must feel DYNAMIC, OFF-KILTER, figures reaching toward edges, weight concentrated on one side. Centered, balanced layouts with equal visual weight on each side lose all the tension and drama.
- **NOT cute, friendly, or warm** — this aesthetic has an edge of DRAMA and DANGER. Noir undertones, trapped figures, violent motion, desperate reaching. It should feel like a thriller movie poster, never cheerful or welcoming.
- **NOT Memphis or Pop Art** — no patterns, no polka dots, no comic-book halftone dots, no Ben-Day, no zigzag decorations. Pure flat black silhouette against solid ground. If there's pattern or decoration, it's wrong.
- **NOT Keith Haring** — Haring uses thick uniform black outlines around filled colored shapes with radiating motion lines. Bass uses solid black silhouettes with torn paper edges and NO outlines. Haring is joyful and rhythmic; Bass is dramatic and urgent.
- This must look like a 1960s Saul Bass movie title sequence frozen into a single frame — torn paper, black silhouettes, reaching hands, a single hot orange-red accent, maximum drama, minimum decoration, the human figure as urgent graphic shape.
