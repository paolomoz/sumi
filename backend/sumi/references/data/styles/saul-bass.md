# saul-bass

Bold paper cutout shapes slicing across the frame like torn construction paper — dramatic black silhouettes, punchy orange-red accents, figures reduced to jagged geometric fragments. This is the hand reaching through vertical bars in The Man with the Golden Arm, the spiral of bodies in Vertigo, the running man reduced to a faceless black form against hot orange. Movie poster drama distilled into sharp-edged urgency.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Jet black (#000000), Saul Bass orange-red (#E34234), warm white/cream (#FDF5E6)
- Background: Warm cream (#FDF5E6), stark white (#FFFFFF), or solid black (#000000) — always high contrast
- Accents: Mustard yellow (#E8B923), olive green (#5C6B4A), brick red (#9B3D3D), teal (#2A7B7F) — used sparingly, one accent color per composition
- Text: Black on cream/white, or reversed white/cream on black — never colored text, always maximum contrast

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Classic | Black + orange-red + cream — the quintessential Saul Bass triad, Vertigo/Anatomy of a Murder energy |
| Silhouette | Pure black figures on stark white, single orange-red accent element — maximum graphic impact |
| Inverted | Cream/white cutout shapes on black ground, orange-red highlight — nighttime noir drama |
| Earth Accent | Black + cream + olive green OR mustard yellow — for a more restrained, sophisticated variation |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Cutout** | Torn paper edges, layered silhouettes, visible craft aesthetic | Shapes look hand-cut from construction paper with slightly imperfect edges, overlapping layers creating depth, fingers and limbs as sharp angular fragments |
| **Silhouette** | Pure black figures against solid color, no interior detail | Human forms reduced to their most dramatic outline — a running figure, a reaching hand, a falling body — legible instantly but completely abstracted |
| **Fragmented** | Figures broken into geometric pieces, cubist influence | A face split into angled planes, an arm severed into separate black shapes, the whole image shattered but still recognizable as human action |
| **Bars/Stripes** | Vertical or diagonal bars slicing across the composition | Thick parallel stripes cutting through figures, creating rhythm and tension, the iconic "trapped" motif from The Man with the Golden Arm |

## Visual Elements

- Jagged paper-cut silhouettes with slightly rough, hand-torn edges — not smooth vector curves but tactile craft edges
- Human figures reduced to black shapes — no facial features, no internal details, just the dramatic outline of a pose
- Reaching hands with separated angular fingers, each digit a distinct sharp black shape
- Thick vertical or diagonal bars/stripes slicing across the frame, fragmenting figures behind them
- Spiral forms — bodies tumbling in circular descent, the Vertigo spiral of falling
- Single bold accent color punching through black-and-white compositions — one orange arm, one red shape
- Overlapping paper layers with visible edges, creating depth through simple overlay
- Figures in motion — running, falling, reaching, grasping — frozen at maximum drama
- Negative space as a design element — white shapes cut out of black fields
- Geometric fragmentation of human forms — faces as triangular planes, bodies as angular shards
- Bold flat shapes with no gradients, no shading, no dimensional rendering — pure graphic silhouette
- Asymmetric dynamic compositions — figures off-center, reaching toward or fleeing from frame edges
- Eyes as simple white shapes cut from black (when showing faces), sometimes a spiral or circle

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Large dominant silhouette figure in center, smaller supporting shapes radiating around, bars subdividing the space | The Man with the Golden Arm — large arm reaching through vertical bars |
| Flow/process | Figure in motion across the frame, body fragmented into stages of movement, a single directional thrust | Anatomy of a Murder — horizontal body breaking into pieces |
| Connections | Reaching hands from opposite sides, fingers nearly touching across negative space, tension in the gap | West Side Story — competing forces reaching toward center |
| Cycles | Spiral of falling/rotating figures, circular descent pattern, vertigo motion | Vertigo — bodies tumbling in concentric spiral |
| Comparison | Split frame with contrasting silhouettes on each side, single color accent bridging | Walk on the Wild Side — black cat silhouette against geometric divisions |
| Categories | Each category as a distinct bold silhouette shape, arranged in a grid or scattered across white ground | Symbol system — each idea as one iconic cut-paper shape |
| Tension | Bars/stripes fragmenting a trapped figure, reaching through constraints | The Man with the Golden Arm — desperation and entrapment |
| Networks | Multiple small silhouette figures scattered across the field, connected by eye-line or gesture | Exodus — crowd of abstracted human shapes moving as one |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Saul Bass Metaphor |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Data/information | Proportionally sized silhouette shapes — larger form = more importance |
| Processes | Fragmented figure in sequential motion, body parts distributed left-to-right showing action stages |
| Systems | Interlocking angular shapes fitting together like a cut-paper puzzle |
| Connections | Reaching hands from different directions, fingers extending toward each other across negative space |
| Growth | Expanding spiral from center outward, or figure rising/running upward along diagonal |
| Time | Left-to-right sequence of fragmented body positions, motion blur achieved through repeated overlapping shapes |
| Hierarchy | Large dominant central silhouette with smaller supporting shapes beneath/around |
| Protection | Figure enclosed within vertical bars or frame, arms reaching outward |
| Speed | Diagonal thrust, figure leaning forward, fragmented trailing edges suggesting motion blur |
| Stability | Solid black rectangle or square anchoring composition, vertical figure planted firmly |
| Users/people | Black silhouette figures — faceless but instantly recognizable through pose and gesture |
| Ideas | Lightbulb shape or radiating starburst rendered as cut-paper form with sharp edges |
| Energy | Explosive fragmentation, shapes bursting outward from center, diagonal dynamic tension |
| Tension/conflict | Hands reaching toward each other but not touching, figures separated by bars, bodies in opposition |

## Typography

- Bold condensed sans-serif, often custom hand-lettered to match the cut-paper aesthetic
- Headlines as graphic elements — text treated as a shape, not separate from the composition
- Letters can be cut from the composition, white letters through black, or vice versa
- Vertically stacked lettering common — words reading downward in a column
- Slight imperfection in letter shapes — mimicking hand-cut quality, not digitally perfect
- BLACK or dark text only — text never in accent colors
- Upper and lowercase mixed, but uppercase preferred for titles
- Text integrated into the negative space, working with silhouettes not against them

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT Art Deco** — Art Deco is symmetrical, ornamental, gold-leafed luxury. Saul Bass is raw, urgent, asymmetric, and stripped of decoration. No sunbursts, no ziggurats, no geometric borders.
- **NOT polish vector graphics** — Shapes should have a hand-crafted, slightly rough paper-cut quality. Perfectly smooth bezier curves destroy the tactile energy. The edges should feel torn, not machined.
- **NOT colorful** — This is fundamentally a black + white + ONE accent color palette. Multiple colors working together destroys the graphic impact. If it looks like a rainbow, it's wrong.
- **NOT literal or detailed** — Saul Bass figures are abstracted to pure silhouette. No interior detail, no faces, no realistic anatomy. If you can identify the figure's expression, you've added too much.
- **NOT symmetrical or balanced** — Compositions should feel dynamic, off-kilter, figures reaching toward edges. Centered, balanced layouts lose the tension.
- **NOT cute or friendly** — This aesthetic has an edge of drama and danger. Noir undertones, trapped figures, violent motion. Never cheerful or welcoming.
- **NOT Memphis or Pop Art** — No patterns, no dots, no comic elements. Pure flat silhouette against solid color.

## Reference Images

- Reference: Classic Saul Bass movie posters — The Man with the Golden Arm (reaching hand through bars), Vertigo (spiral), Anatomy of a Murder (fragmented body), Exodus (crowd silhouettes)
- Look for: Black silhouettes on cream/orange, paper-cut edge quality, fragmented human figures, vertical bar motifs, spiral/falling compositions
