# shan-shui

Mountains and water dissolving into infinite mist — traditional Chinese landscape painting where jagged peaks emerge from clouds, twisted pines cling to impossible cliffs, and tiny scholars contemplate vastness from pavilions perched on precipices. Ink-washed mountains layer from dark foreground to pale distances, with vast empty space (xu) carrying as much meaning as the painted forms (shi). This is philosophy made visible: humanity small within nature's immensity.

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Pure Ink (Shui-mo) | Full range of black-to-pale-grey ink only on warm paper, no color |
| Blue-Green (Qing-lu) | Mineral blue-green + ochre + ink outlines + gold clouds on silk |
| Literati (Wenren) | Pale grey washes + black ink details + vermillion seals + aged paper |
| Mist-shrouded | Palest grey washes dissolving to white + single dark focal point + red seal accent |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Northern Song Monumental** | Towering vertical peaks, architectural grandeur | Main peak dominating composition, detailed rocks and trees, tiny humans for scale, ink washes with texture strokes (cun) |
| **Southern Song Intimate** | Corner compositions, vast empty space | Subject pushed to one corner, most of painting is empty mist, Ma Yuan/Xia Gui style, poetic minimalism |
| **Literati (Wenren)** | Scholarly understatement, calligraphy integration | Pale washy mountains, emphasis on brushwork over representation, poetry inscribed as part of composition, amateur aesthetic |
| **Blue-Green (Qing-lu)** | Mineral color, decorative richness | Bright blue-green mountains with gold clouds, Tang dynasty opulence, more decorative than atmospheric |

## Visual Elements

- Layered mountain ranges receding into distance — darkest and most detailed in foreground, each successive range paler and simpler until the farthest peaks are barely visible grey ghosts
- Vast empty space representing mist, water, and sky — paper left unpainted, the emptiness as compositionally important as the mountains
- Twisted pine trees clinging to cliffsides — gnarled trunks with distinctive flat-topped canopies, often leaning dramatically outward over voids
- Texture strokes (cun fa) — repeated small strokes building up rock surfaces: raindrop dots, axe-cut strokes, hemp-fiber strokes, each technique giving different rock character
- Waterfalls as vertical white ribbons of unpainted paper cutting through dark mountains
- Tiny human figures dwarfed by landscape — scholars in robes contemplating from pavilion, fisherman on boat barely visible, travelers on mountain paths
- Pavilions and bridges perched on impossible precipices — architectural elements tiny against mountain immensity
- Clouds and mist as horizontal bands breaking up mountain forms — not fluffy clouds but atmospheric layers
- Rivers winding through valleys as white negative space serpentine paths
- Calligraphic inscriptions brushed vertically as integral compositional elements — poetry, artist signature, colophons
- Red seal stamps clustered in corners or at inscription endings
- Bamboo groves and willow banks marking water's edge
- Boats with tiny figures floating on unpainted water
- Distant geese flying in formation across empty sky

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Towering main peak with subsidiary peaks descending around it | Northern Song monumental composition — the most important element is LARGEST and HIGHEST |
| Flow/process | River winding from foreground through middle distance to far mountains | Water's journey as path through landscape, elements placed along the banks |
| Connections | Bridges spanning between cliffs, paths winding between peaks | Architectural elements connecting what nature separated |
| Cycles | Four scrolls showing four seasons of same landscape | Seasonal transformation series — spring mist, summer lush, autumn sparse, winter bare |
| Comparison | "One corner" composition — subject in one corner, vast empty space as the other | Ma Yuan style — asymmetrical balance through emptiness |
| Categories | Different mountains/regions each with distinctive texture stroke treatment | Each peak characterized by different cun technique |
| Growth | Vertical scroll format — earth at bottom, ascent through trees and rocks to peak to sky | The eye travels upward from mundane ground to spiritual heights |
| Networks | Mountain range system with ridgelines connecting peaks | Geological structure as network diagram |
| Layers | Three depths: near (dark, detailed), middle (lighter, simpler), far (pale wash, minimal) | Classical depth layering with atmospheric perspective |
| Container | Mountain frame around central void — peaks surrounding empty center | Space enclosed by mountains, void as subject |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Shan-shui Metaphor |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Data/information | Ink density — concentrated data as dark detailed areas, sparse data as pale washes |
| Processes | River flowing through landscape — the journey from source in mountains to mouth at sea |
| Systems | Mountain range as interconnected system — ridges connect peaks, valleys channel water |
| Connections | Bridges spanning gorges, paths winding between points, boats crossing water |
| Growth | Vertical ascent from earth through foothills to peaks to sky — literally upward progress |
| Time | Seasonal scrolls — same landscape transformed through spring-summer-autumn-winter |
| Hierarchy | Peak height and ink density — the most important element is the tallest, darkest mountain |
| Protection | Mountain enclosure — peaks surrounding and sheltering the valley within |
| Speed | Waterfall rush, flying geese, wind-bent trees |
| Stability | Massive mountain base, ancient pine rooted in rock |
| Users/people | Tiny scholars and travelers — humanity small but present, contemplating the vastness |
| Ideas | Empty space (xu) — the void IS the idea, pregnant with possibility |
| Energy | Waterfall force, mountain upthrust, wind through pines |
| Complexity | Dense texture strokes building rock surfaces, intricate cliff formations |
| Simplicity | Vast empty mist, single bare tree, minimal Southern Song corners |
| Knowledge | Scholar in pavilion contemplating landscape — the learned perspective |

## Typography

- Vertical brush calligraphy in black ink — running script (xingshu) or regular script (kaishu)
- Poetry inscribed as integral part of composition, not separate from image
- Calligraphy placed in empty sky areas or alongside mountains
- Multiple colophon inscriptions acceptable (collector seals, later commentaries)
- Red seal stamps — artist seals, collector seals, appreciation seals — clustered at inscription endings
- Title seals (yin zhang) in upper corners
- No horizontal Western text blocks — all text vertical, all text brushed
- If Latin alphabet needed, use a brush-style font placed vertically

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT sumi-e** — Shan-shui is LANDSCAPE painting with spatial depth and geological structure, not Japanese ink painting emphasis on single-stroke brush expression. Shan-shui has COMPLEX TEXTURE STROKES (cun) building rock surfaces, sumi-e is minimal strokes.
- **NOT flat decorative** — This has ATMOSPHERIC PERSPECTIVE with multiple depth layers. Mountains RECEDE into space, they don't float on a flat ground.
- **NOT Western landscape painting** — No single-point perspective, no fixed horizon line, no cast shadows, no specific time-of-day lighting
- **NOT photorealistic** — Mountains are stylized with traditional texture strokes, not photographically rendered
- **NOT colorful** — Unless specifically using blue-green (qing-lu) variant, this is primarily INK on paper with only seal red as accent
- **NO empty white background as negative space** — The "empty" space represents MIST, WATER, and SKY, not graphic design negative space. It has atmospheric meaning.
- **NOT symmetrical** — Compositions are ASYMMETRICAL, often with subject pushed to one side or corner
- **NOT cluttered from edge to edge** — There MUST be vast empty space. If mountains fill more than 50% of the composition, it's wrong.
- **NO modern architecture or objects** — Only traditional elements: pavilions, bridges, boats, robed figures
- **NOT anime/manga landscape style** — This is traditional literati painting, not Japanese popular culture interpretation
