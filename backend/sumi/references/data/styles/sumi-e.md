# sumi-e

Black ink brush strokes on white paper — from bold, confident bamboo stalks to misty mountain washes dissolving into vast emptiness. A single red sun or seal stamp punctuates the monochrome silence. Every brush stroke visible, every empty space intentional, the art of saying everything with almost nothing.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Jet black sumi ink in full concentration, diluted grey ink washes fading to near-transparency
- Background: Off-white rice paper with subtle warm texture — slightly cream, never bright white
- Accents: Vermillion red (for sun disc, seal stamps, and selective highlights), soft blush pink (for cherry blossom petals only)
- Extended: Pale grey-blue mist washes for distant mountains, faint ochre for earth and shorelines

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Classic Sansui | Black ink + grey washes + off-white paper + single vermillion red sun disc |
| Cherry Blossom | Black ink branches + soft pink petals + vermillion red accents + warm white ground |
| Pure Ink | Black ink only — full range from jet black to palest grey wash on off-white, no color at all |
| Crane | Black ink + soft purple-pink washes + white paper showing through as the crane's body |
| Enso | Bold black circle + bamboo silhouette + vermillion red stamp + clean white ground |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Sansui (Mountain-Water)** | Misty landscapes with atmospheric depth | Layered mountain silhouettes dissolving from dark foreground to pale grey distance, mist erasing the middle ground, a tiny boat or figure dwarfed by nature, red sun hovering above |
| **Bamboo** | Bold confident single-stroke brush work | Individual bamboo stalks painted with single loaded brush strokes — thick trunks tapering to thin leaf tips, visible bristle texture in every stroke, pure black on white, no wash |
| **Kacho-ga (Bird-Flower)** | Delicate natural subjects with ink splatter accents | Cranes, cherry blossoms, chrysanthemums, plum branches — combining bold ink lines with soft diluted washes, ink drops splattered for texture, calligraphy integrated into composition |
| **Enso** | Bold circular zen brush stroke as framing device | A single dramatic circle (enso) painted with one confident brush stroke — thick, slightly imperfect, containing or framing the subject matter within it |

## Visual Elements

- Bold, confident brush strokes with visible bristle texture — each stroke painted once, never reworked, carrying the energy of the artist's arm movement
- Ink wash gradients created by diluting sumi ink — from velvety jet black at full concentration to the palest grey ghost, with every shade between
- Vast empty white space ("ma") as the most important compositional element — the paper breathes, emptiness carries as much meaning as the ink
- Misty atmospheric effects where ink washes dissolve and bleed at their edges, suggesting fog, distance, and the unseen
- Cherry blossom branches reaching across the composition with gnarled black bark and clusters of soft pink petals, some petals falling
- Mountain silhouettes layered in diminishing ink concentration — dark peaks in front, pale grey ghosts behind, the farthest barely visible
- A single bold vermillion red circle (the sun) placed asymmetrically as the only pure color accent against the monochrome field
- Small red seal stamps (hanko) in corners — square or rectangular with white characters reversed out of red
- Calligraphic text brushed vertically in black ink, integrated as visual rhythm rather than separate from the art
- Twisted pine trees and gnarled branches painted with dry-brush technique — rough, textured strokes where the bristles separate
- Ink splatter and controlled accidents — drops flung from the brush tip adding organic texture and spontaneity
- Figures rendered as minimal silhouettes — a fisherman is just a dark shape on a boat, a traveler is a simple robed form with a hat

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Layered mountain silhouettes — darkest/largest at bottom, palest/smallest at top, with mist between each layer | Classic sansui depth layering, near-middle-far |
| Flow/process | A river or path winding from foreground to distant mountains, elements placed along its course like stepping stones | Boat journey from shore through mist to distant peak |
| Connections | Branches reaching across empty space to connect separate elements — a plum branch linking two scenes, a flock of birds connecting earth to sky | Cherry blossom branch arching from left side to touch the mountain on the right |
| Cycles | Seasonal subjects arranged in circular or four-corner composition — spring blossoms, summer bamboo, autumn chrysanthemum, winter pine | Traditional shiki-e (four seasons) composition |
| Comparison | Two subjects placed on opposite sides with vast empty space between them — the contrast IS the empty space | Crane on left, mountain on right, the white paper river between them |
| Categories | Distinct natural subjects (bamboo, orchid, chrysanthemum, plum) each in their own ink treatment grouped on one scroll | The Four Gentlemen (shikunshi) arrangement |
| Growth | Bamboo rising from bottom of frame upward — thick base strokes, thinner as it reaches, new shoots branching | Single bamboo stalk growing from earth to sky |
| Networks | Branching tree structure — a central twisted trunk with branches reaching outward, each branch carrying different elements | Gnarled pine with branches holding different subjects |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Sumi-e Metaphor |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Data/information | Ink drops of varying size — larger drops for bigger quantities, darker ink for more importance |
| Processes | A river flowing through landscape, passing different scenes along its banks |
| Systems | A twisted tree with interconnected branches, each branch bearing different fruit or flower |
| Connections | Branches reaching across empty space, birds flying between elements, paths through mist |
| Growth | Bamboo shooting upward, cherry buds opening to full bloom, seedling to tree |
| Time | Seasons changing across the composition — bare branch on left blooming on right |
| Hierarchy | Mountain layering — the most important peak darkest and largest, lesser peaks fading to pale grey mist |
| Protection | Enso circle enclosing the protected element, pine canopy sheltering what's beneath |
| Speed | Brush strokes getting faster and thinner — splattered ink drops trailing behind a swooping bird |
| Stability | Ancient gnarled pine tree rooted deep, wide mountain base anchoring the composition |
| Users/people | Minimal silhouette figures — a scholar in a boat, a traveler with staff, a monk under a tree — always small against nature |
| Ideas | Red sun disc — the single point of color breaking through the monochrome, impossible to ignore |
| Energy | Enso brush stroke — a single explosive circular movement, bold and uncontainable |
| Simplicity/essence | A single bamboo stalk, one flower, one stone — the subject reduced to its purest brushwork |

## Typography

- Vertical brush calligraphy in black sumi ink, written with the same brush as the artwork
- Characters flow naturally as part of the composition, not boxed separately
- Title text can be bold calligraphic strokes — thick, confident, slightly imperfect
- Labels rendered as delicate thin-brush writing alongside the elements they describe
- A red seal stamp placed near the calligraphy as signature and compositional accent
- No digital fonts, no sans-serif, no horizontal Latin text blocks — everything brushed, everything vertical when possible
- If Latin alphabet is needed, use a brush-script style that echoes the ink quality

## Anti-Patterns

- NOT a watercolor painting — sumi-e uses INK (sumi), not transparent watercolor pigments. The marks are brush strokes, not soft wet-on-wet washes
- NOT a detailed realistic rendering — sumi-e captures essence with minimal strokes, it does NOT fill in every detail
- NOT a grey-scale photograph or digital grayscale filter — the white paper and visible brush texture are essential
- NOT a clean vector illustration — every stroke must show the brush bristles, the ink loading, the speed of the hand
- NOT cluttered — if more than 40% of the paper has ink on it, there's too much. The empty space IS the style
- This must look like a brush was loaded with ink and swept across rice paper in confident single strokes, not like a computer generated a grayscale image
