# sumi-e

Black ink brush strokes on white paper — from bold, confident bamboo stalks to misty mountain washes dissolving into vast emptiness. A single red sun or seal stamp punctuates the monochrome silence. Every brush stroke visible, every empty space intentional, the art of saying everything with almost nothing. The loaded brush touches rice paper once, the ink flows where gravity and bristle-spread dictate, and the artist's arm movement is frozen forever in the drying sumi.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Jet black sumi ink (#1A1A1A) at full concentration, diluted grey ink washes in graduated steps (#6E6E6E medium, #A8A8A8 light, #D4D4D4 ghost wash)
- Background: Off-white rice paper (#F5F0E8) with subtle warm texture — slightly cream, never bright white, never cold grey
- Accents: Vermillion red (#CC3333) for sun disc, seal stamps, and selective focal highlights; soft blush pink (#E8C4C4) for cherry blossom petals only
- Extended: Pale grey-blue (#C0CDD8) for distant mountain mist washes, faint warm ochre (#D4C8A0) for earth tones and shoreline suggestions
- Text: Black sumi ink (#1A1A1A) brushed directly — text IS the same medium as the art

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Classic Sansui | Black ink + graduated grey washes from dark to pale ghost + off-white rice paper + single vermillion red sun disc floating in the vast sky |
| Cherry Blossom Season | Black ink branches gnarled with age + soft blush pink petals scattering + vermillion red accents at branch joints + warm cream paper ground |
| Pure Ink (Suiboku) | Black ink ONLY — the full tonal range from velvety jet black to palest grey transparency, on warm off-white. No color whatsoever. Pure monochrome |
| Crane at Dawn | Bold black ink silhouette body + soft grey-blue mist washes + white paper showing through as the crane's white plumage + vermillion crown spot |
| Enso Meditation | Single bold black enso circle + bamboo silhouette inside or beside it + vermillion red seal stamp in corner + clean white ground breathing around everything |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Sansui (Mountain-Water)** | Misty landscapes with atmospheric depth and spiritual vastness | Layered mountain silhouettes dissolving from dark foreground peaks to pale grey distant ghosts, mist erasing the middle ground into white void, a tiny boat or solitary figure dwarfed by immense nature, red sun hovering in the empty upper sky |
| **Bamboo** | Bold single-stroke brushwork showing mastery and confidence | Individual bamboo stalks painted with single loaded brush strokes — thick dark trunks tapering to thin whipping leaf tips, visible bristle texture showing the brush's splay in every stroke, pure black on white, no wash, no softness |
| **Kacho-ga (Bird-Flower)** | Delicate natural subjects combining precision and spontaneity | Cranes with extended wings, cherry blossoms on gnarled branches, chrysanthemums bending in wind, plum branches crossing the composition — bold ink lines for structure combined with soft diluted washes for atmosphere, ink drops deliberately splattered for texture, vertical calligraphy woven into the image |
| **Enso** | Bold circular zen brush stroke as philosophical framing device | A single dramatic circle (enso) painted with one explosive confident arm sweep — thick, deliberately imperfect, gap intentional where the brush lifted, ink pooling where pressure was greatest — containing or framing the subject matter within its circumference |

## Visual Elements

- Bold, confident brush strokes with visible bristle texture — each stroke painted once with a loaded brush, never reworked or touched up, carrying the frozen energy of the artist's full arm movement from shoulder to wrist
- Ink wash gradients created by diluting sumi ink with water — from velvety jet black at full concentration through five or six graduated greys to the palest ghost wash barely distinguishable from the paper, with every intermediate shade living between
- Vast empty white space ("ma") as the most important compositional element — the paper breathes, emptiness carries meaning equal to the ink, and at least 50-60% of the composition should be untouched paper
- Misty atmospheric effects where ink washes dissolve and bleed at their edges, trailing off into nothing — suggesting fog, vast distance, the unseen, the unknowable
- Cherry blossom branches reaching diagonally across the composition with gnarled black bark (dry-brush texture) and clusters of soft blush pink petals, some petals detaching and falling through empty space
- Mountain silhouettes layered in diminishing ink concentration — dark bold peaks nearest the viewer, medium-grey peaks behind, pale grey ghosts behind those, the farthest barely distinguishable from the mist
- A single bold vermillion red circle (the sun) placed asymmetrically in the upper portion as the only pure color accent piercing the monochrome field — commanding despite being small
- Small red seal stamps (hanko) in corners — square or rectangular with white characters reversed out of red ink, functioning as both signature and compositional anchor
- Calligraphic text brushed vertically in black ink, integrated as visual rhythm and texture rather than floating separately from the artwork
- Twisted ancient pine trees and gnarled branches painted with dry-brush technique — rough, textured strokes where the individual bristles separated, leaving gaps of white between the ink trails
- Ink splatter and controlled accidents — drops deliberately flung from the brush tip adding organic randomness and tactile spontaneity to precise compositions
- Figures rendered as minimal dark silhouettes — a fisherman is a dark hunched shape in a boat, a traveler is a simple robed form with a conical hat, a monk sits as a curved triangle — always tiny against vast nature
- Water suggested by horizontal wash bands that fade to nothing, or by leaving the paper completely blank and letting the viewer's mind fill the river or lake

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Layered mountain silhouettes — darkest/largest at bottom foreground, palest/smallest receding to upper background, with horizontal mist bands erasing the transitions between layers | Classic sansui depth layering: near-middle-far, with ma (emptiness) between each plane |
| Flow/process | A river or winding path flowing from foreground to distant mountains, elements placed along its course like stepping stones or waypoints in a journey | Boat journey from near shore through mist to distant peak — the path is the story |
| Connections | Branches reaching across empty space to link separate elements — a plum branch arching from left side to touch the mountain on the right, a flock of cranes bridging earth to sky | Cherry blossom branch as visual bridge connecting two sides of the composition |
| Cycles | Seasonal subjects arranged in circular or four-corner composition — spring cherry blossoms (upper left), summer bamboo (upper right), autumn chrysanthemum (lower right), winter bare pine (lower left) | Traditional shiki-e (four seasons) arrangement on a single scroll |
| Comparison | Two subjects placed on opposite sides of the composition with vast empty white space between them — the contrast IS the emptiness, the tension lives in the gap | Crane on left facing mountain on right, the white paper river of silence between them |
| Categories | Distinct natural subjects each rendered in their own ink treatment, grouped together: bamboo (bold strokes), orchid (delicate lines), chrysanthemum (soft washes), plum (angular branches) | The Four Gentlemen (shikunshi) — each plant representing a virtue |
| Growth | Single bamboo stalk rising from bottom of frame upward through the full height — thick solid base strokes, thinner as it ascends, new shoots branching at nodes, tips whipping freely at top | Bamboo growing from earth to sky, rooted and reaching |
| Networks | Branching tree structure — a central twisted ancient trunk with branches reaching outward in different directions, each branch carrying different elements at its tip | Gnarled pine with branches bearing subjects like offerings at each end |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Sumi-e Metaphor |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Data/information | Ink drops of varying size and darkness — larger drops for bigger quantities, darker ink concentration for greater importance, pale washes for background data |
| Processes | A river flowing through landscape from foreground to distance, passing different scenes and subjects arranged along its banks at each stage |
| Systems | A twisted ancient tree with interconnected branches, each branch bearing different fruit, flower, or element — all growing from one root system |
| Connections | Branches reaching across empty space, cranes flying between elements, paths winding through mist, calligraphic lines linking subjects |
| Growth | Bamboo shooting upward from single root, cherry buds opening from tight knots to full bloom, seedling stroke growing to tree — always vertical rising energy |
| Time | Seasons changing across the composition — bare branch on left gradually blooming on right, winter dissolving into spring across the horizontal axis |
| Hierarchy | Mountain layering — the most important peak darkest and largest in foreground, lesser peaks fading to progressively paler grey mist behind |
| Protection | Enso circle enclosing and sheltering the protected element within its brushed boundary, or pine canopy arching protectively over what grows beneath |
| Speed | Brush strokes getting faster and thinner — splattered ink drops trailing behind a swooping bird or rushing water, the visible acceleration of the brush |
| Stability | Ancient gnarled pine tree rooted deep in rock, or wide mountain base anchoring the entire composition with its dark mass |
| Users/people | Minimal silhouette figures — a scholar alone in a boat, a traveler with bamboo staff on a path, a monk meditating beneath a tree — always small against immense nature |
| Ideas | Red sun disc — the single point of pure color breaking through the monochrome field, impossible to ignore, illuminating everything around it |
| Energy | Enso brush stroke — a single explosive circular arm movement, bold and uncontainable, the brush loaded heavy and swung with full-body commitment |
| Simplicity/essence | A single bamboo stalk, one flower on one branch, one stone in empty space — the subject reduced to its purest possible brushwork, nothing added that isn't essential |

## Typography

- Vertical brush calligraphy in black sumi ink, written with the same brush and ink as the artwork — text and image are one medium
- Characters flow naturally as part of the visual composition, positioned to balance the ink masses, not boxed or separated in their own zone
- Title text rendered as bold calligraphic strokes — thick, confident, slightly imperfect as all brush marks are, carrying gestural energy
- Labels rendered as delicate thin-brush writing (hosofude) placed alongside the elements they describe — small, precise, subordinate to the image
- A red seal stamp placed near the calligraphy as both signature and compositional color accent — never omitted, always asymmetric
- NO digital fonts, NO sans-serif typefaces, NO horizontal Latin text blocks — everything brushed by hand, everything vertical when Japanese, brush-script style when Latin alphabet is needed
- If Latin text must appear, use a brush-script or calligraphic face that echoes the ink quality and imperfection of the painted elements

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT watercolor painting** — Sumi-e uses INK (sumi), not transparent watercolor pigments. The medium is carbon-black ink on absorbent paper. The marks are decisive brush strokes, not soft wet-on-wet color washes bleeding into rainbows.
- **NOT detailed realistic rendering** — Sumi-e captures essence and spirit with minimal strokes. It does NOT fill in every detail, every texture, every shadow. If the image looks "finished" in a Western illustration sense, it has too much. Remove.
- **NOT a greyscale photograph or digital desaturation filter** — The warm off-white paper, the visible brush bristle texture, and the ink pooling at stroke beginnings/endings are essential. A color photograph converted to grey is not sumi-e.
- **NOT a clean vector illustration** — Every stroke must show the physical brush: the bristle spread, the ink loading (wet vs. dry), the speed of the hand, the moment the brush lifted. Machine-perfect lines destroy the aesthetic.
- **NOT ukiyo-e** — Ukiyo-e is woodblock print with flat color fills, bold outlines, and decorative pattern. Sumi-e is pure ink painting with wash gradients and empty space. They share Japanese origin but are opposite in almost every visual quality.
- **NOT shan-shui** — While both depict mountain-water landscapes, shan-shui (Chinese tradition) tends toward denser, more detailed compositions with more ink coverage. Sumi-e (Japanese wabi-sabi sensibility) pushes further toward emptiness and minimal stroke count.
- **NOT cluttered** — If more than 40% of the paper surface has ink on it, there is too much. **The empty space IS the style.** Ma (negative space) is not a gap to be filled; it is the primary expressive element.
- This must look like a real brush was loaded with ground sumi ink and swept across handmade rice paper in confident single strokes — not like a computer generated a greyscale image with a "Japanese" filter applied.

## Best For

Philosophical concepts, simplicity and essence communication, nature-technology balance, zen and mindfulness topics, process flows with contemplative pacing, before-after transformations, reduction and simplification narratives, any content that benefits from elegant restraint, the power of empty space, and the idea that what is NOT shown matters as much as what is.
